    "postitle": "PM lays foundation stone of Major Dhyan Chand Sports Varsity in Meerut",
    "postText": "The Prime Minister remembered Major Dhyan Chand who was  active in Meerut. A few months back, the central government had named the country's biggest sports award after the sporting icon. The Sports University of Meerut is being dedicated to Major Dhyan Chand  today, the Prime Minister said.\n\nThe Prime Minister noted the change of ethos in the state of Uttar Pradesh where earlier criminals and mafias used to play their games. He recalled the period where illegal occupation, harassing daughters used to go scot free.  He remembered the insecurity and lawlessness of earlier times. He lauded that now the Yogi government is imposing fear of law among such criminals. This change has brought confidence among the daughters of bringing laurels for the entire country.\n\nThe Prime Minister said youth is the cornerstone and also expansion of New India. Youth is the shaper and also the leader of New India. Our youth today have the heritage of antiquity and also have a sense of modernity. And so, where the youth will go, India will also move. And the world is going to go where India goes.\n\nThe Prime Minister highlighted that in the last few years, his government has given top priority to the Indian players to get four tools - resources, modern facilities for training, international exposure and transparency in selection.  The Prime Minister stressed that for sports in the country to thrive, it is necessary that the youth should have faith in sports and should be encouraged to take up sports as a profession. “This is my resolve, and my dream too! I wish our youth to see sports like other professions”, he said. The Prime Minister remarked that the government linked sports with employment. Schemes like Target Olympics Podium (TOPS) are providing all support to top sportspersons to compete at the highest level. Khelo India Abhiyan is recognizing talent very early and all support is being given to groom them for international level.India’s recent performance in Olympics and Para-Olympics, said the Prime Minister, is a proof of a new India’s rise in the play field. With the advent of sporting infrastructure in villages and small towns, there are a rising number of sportspersons from these towns.\n\nThe Prime Minister said in the new National Education Policy, priority has been given to sports. Sports have now been kept in the same category as science, commerce or other studies. Earlier sports were considered as extra curricular  activities, but now sports schools will have it as a proper subject. The Prime Minister said that the sporting eco-system comprising sports, sports management, sports writing, sports psychology etc, creates new possibilities. He said this generates trust in the society that moving towards sports is the right decision. With resources, a sporting culture takes shape and Sports University will play a big role in this, he added. Talking about the sporting culture of Meerut, the Prime Minister pointed out that the city exports sporting goods to more than 100 countries. This way, Meerut is not only vocal for local but also turning local into global, the Prime Minister said emphasizing the need for making the country Aatmnirbhar in the sector through the emerging sports clusters.\n\nThe Prime Minister mentioned that the double-engine government in Uttar Pradesh is establishing many universities. He listed Mahayogi Guru Gorakhnath Ayush University in Gorakhpur, Dr Rajendra Prasad Law University in Prayagraj, State Institute of Forensic Sciences in Lucknow, Raja Mahendra Pratap singh State University in Aligarh, Maa Shakumbari University in Saharanpur and Major Dhyan Chand University in Meerut. “Our goal is clear. The Youth should not only become role models but also recognize their role models”, The Prime Minister commented.\n\nThe Prime MInister informed that under the Svamitiva scheme more than 23 lakh titles (Gharauni) have been given in 75 districts. Farmers of the state have received crores of rupees in their account under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi. Farmers of the state have also benefited by the record payment to the sugarcane farmers. Similarly, 12 thousand crore rupees worth of ethanol have been purchased from UP, the Prime Minister informed.\n\nThe Prime Minister remarked that the role of governments is like that of a guardian. The government should encourage those with merit and should not try to justify mistakes as follies of youth. The PM congratulated the current Uttar Pradesh government for creating a record number of Government jobs for the youth. Thousands of youth who got training from ITI have been given employment in big companies. He added that lakhs of youth have benefited from National Apprenticeship Scheme and Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana. Meerut is also becoming the hub of connectivity by Ganga expressway, Regional Rapid Rail Transit System and Metro.",

The strategic Tanakpur-Pithoragarh road will now have all-weather connectivity that will facilitate the unhindered movement of the army to the border areas and improved connectivity for the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra.\n\nIn an endeavour to expand the medical infrastructure of the state and provide world class medical facilities to the people in all parts of the country, Prime Minister will lay the foundation stone of AIIMS Rishikesh satellite centre in Udham Singh Nagar district and Jagjivan Ram Government Medical College at Pithoragarh. These two hospitals are being built at a cost of about Rs 500 crores and Rs 450 crore respectively. The improved medical infrastructure will not only help the people of Kumaon and Terai regions but also the bordering areas of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nPrime Minister will lay the foundation stone for the construction of about 2400 homes for the economically weaker section in the cities of Sitarganj and Kashipur in Udham Singh Nagar district. These homes will be built at a cumulative cost of more than 170 crores under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna (Urban).\n\nTo improve the tap water supply in the rural areas of the state, the Prime Minister will lay the foundation stone of 73 water supply schemes across 13 districts of the state under the Jal Jeevan Mission. The schemes will cumulatively cost around Rs 1250 crore and will benefit more than 1.3 lakh rural households of the state. Further, to ensure regular supply of quality water in urban areas of Haridwar and Nainital, the Prime Minister will also lay the foundation stone of water supply schemes for these two cities. The schemes will provide about 14500 connections in Haridwar and more than 2400 connections in Haldwani, benefitting about one lakh population of Haridwar and about 12000 population of Haldwani.\n\nIn line with the Prime Minister’s vision to create new avenues for tapping the inherent potential of a region, the foundation stone of a 41 acre Aroma Park at Kashipur and a 40 acre Plastic Industrial Park at Sitarganj will be laid. The two projects will be developed by State Infrastructure & Industrial Development Corporation Uttarakhand Limited (SIIDCUL) at a cumulative cost of about 100 crore. The Aroma Park will make use of Uttarakhand's immense potential of floriculture growth because of its unique geographical conditions. The Plastic Industrial Park will be a step to establish the state’s industrial prowess and create employment opportunities for the people.\n\nPrime Minister will also inaugurate two sewage treatment plants of 7 MLD and 1.5 MLD capacity constructed at the cost of about 50 crore at Ramnagar, Nainital. Also, Prime Minister will lay the foundation stone of the construction of nine sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Udham Singh Nagar, to be built at the cost of about 200 crore; and a 78 crore project for upgradation of Sewerage system in Nainital.\n\nPrime Minister will also inaugurate the 5 MegaWatt capacity Suringad-II run of the river hydroelectric project built by Uttarakhand Jal Vidyut Nigam (UJVN) Limited at Munsyari in Pithoragarh district built at a cost of about Rs 50 crore.\n\n",

Singh, who was the Commissioner of Police, remained 'off-duty' for the past nearly six months after he was transferred as Commandant-General of Maharashtra State Home Guards after the major row following a SUV with 20 gelatin sticks found abandoned near the home of industrialist Mukesh Ambani and the death of its owner, Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran. Later, Singh created a furore by his letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray levelling allegations of corruption against the then home minister and senior Nationalist Congress Party leader Anil Deshmukh, who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate and is currently in judicial custody.\n—IANS",

    "postText": "New Delhi: Union Minister of Jal Shakti, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, said on Tuesday that Congress has no right to raise the issue of mob lunching, as the biggest incident of lynching in the history of Independent India happened during Rajiv Gandhi’s era.\nShekhawat’s response came hours after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “Before 2014, the word ‘lynching’ was practically unheard of. #ThankYouModiJi.”\nSpeaking to the media after senior Punjab Congress leader Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi joined the BJP at the party headquarters here, Shekhawat said: “I feel that Congress has no right to raise questions over lynching. The biggest such incident in the history of Independent India under any government occured during the era of Rajiv Gandhi, the father of current Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.”\nBJP national spokesperson R.P. Singh said, “Rahul Gandhi forgets that his father Rajiv Gandhi supported mob lynching of more than 3,000 Sikhs by Congress MPs and workers.”\nReferring to Rajiv Gandhi’s comment, ‘Jab bhi bada ped girta hai, dharti hilti hai’ (whenever a big tree falls, the earth shakes), another BJP leader, Manjinder Singh Sirsa, said,  \n“It is true that Rahul Gandhi didn’t hear about lynching before 2014, because they equated the killings of thousands of innocent Sikhs with fall of a big tree.”\n“Rahul Gandhi heard the word lynching for the first time when Congress leader Sajjan Kumar was sent behind bars for the anti-Sikh riots, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014,” Sirsa said. Quoting Rahul Gandhi’s tweet, BJP IT Cell in-charge Amit Malviya said, “Meet Rajiv Gandhi, father of mob lynching, justifying blood curdling genocide of Sikhs. Congress took to the streets, raised slogans like ‘khoon ka badla khoon se lenge’, raped women, wrapped burning tyres around necks of Sikh men while dogs gorged on charred bodies dumped in drains.” “Ahemdabad (1969), Jalgaon (1970), Moradabad (1980), Nellie (1983), Bhiwandi (1984), Delhi (1984), Ahmedabad (1985), Bhagalpur (1989), Hyderabad (1990), Kanpur (1992), Mumbai (1993). This is just a small list in which more than 100 people died under Nehru-Gandhi parivar’s watch,” Malviya said.\n\n—IANS",

    "postText": "New Delhi: Tokyo Olympics silver medallist Saikhom Mirabai Chanu’s next target is a medal at the 2022 Asian Games. She also has her sights set on a gold at the Paris Olympics in three years’ time.\n\nChanu ended India's over two-decade-long wait for a weightlifting medal at the just-concluded Olympics, clinching the silver medal in the 49kg category.\n\nNow back to the country, she is focussing on the Asian Games gold medal, which remains the only accolade missing from her showcase.\n\n\"My target is now Asian Games, where there is no medal in weightlifting. I will try my best to bring a medal for India in weightlifting from the 2022 Asian Games,\" said Chanu, during a virtual press conference where she was unveiled as brand ambassador of Amway Nutrilite.\n\n\"After that in 2024 (Paris Olympics), I will try to convert this silver medal into gold.\"\n\nChanu won a silver and gold at the 2014 and 2018 Commonwealth Games respectively. In between, she also won the World Championships title in 2017.\n\nShe also has a bronze medal from the 2020 Asian Championships, but an Asian Games medal is missing.\n\nThe 27-year-old from Manipur pulled out of the 2018 Asian Games after failing to recover from a lower back injury, which also forced her to withdraw from the World Championships.\n\nShe acknowledged the contribution of her coach, Vijay Sharma, in her journey to an Olympic medallist.\n\n\"The more I would say, less it would be (Jitna bolu wo kam rahega),\" she said.\n\n\"Whenever my training was bad or I had an injury, he always stood by me ... he has always supported me and motivated me,\" she said, adding he never let her feel low in any of the defeats.\n\nChanu said Sharma treated her \"like a daughter\" and wished that \"the up-and-coming lifters, especially girls, should have a coach like him.\"\n\nThe 27-year-old from Manipur also urged girls to take up sports and stressed on the importance of family support.\n\n\"I just want to say that the young players, especially girls, there is a perception that girls cannot achieve anything, which is wrong. They can do a lot of things, they have lot of power inside them,\" she said.\n\nWhile family responsibilities should not be neglected, she said girls should also express their inner power to do something.\n\n\n\"All girls must have seen such dreams that 'I can also do'. Why can't girls do?\" she declared, exhorting girls to take up weightlifting.\n\n\"I request the families to support their girls in the sport, to go ahead in the fields which they are aspiring.\"\n\n—PTI",

In doing so, he also became only the second Indian to bag an individual gold in the Games.\n\n\nChopra's father Satish Chopra, who has a farming background, credited family support behind his son's achievement.   \n\n\"When one's child achieves success and brings glory to the nation, there are no words to express happiness of parents and entire family. We live in a joint family and we are four brothers. Neeraj (Chopra) has been lucky in the sense that he got full support from entire family, who constantly encouraged and motivated him to pursue his passion,\" he told the media in Panipat.\n\n\nThe athlete's mother Saroj added: \"Today, he has lived up to everyone's expectations and made India proud,\" she said.\n\nChopra's uncle Bhim Chopra, who played a key role in shaping his career, agreed with his brother.\n\n\"God has answered our prayers.\n\n\"It is not only a player's hard work and strong determination that counts, strong family support, constant encouragement and motivation and inculcating good values is important. Neeraj have all these which helped him pursue his aim,\" Bhim Chopra said.\n\nChopra's native Khandra village, near Panipat burst into celebratory mood after their very own child shone bright at sport's biggest stage on Saturday evening.\n\nEven elderly women in the village and family danced and sang after he had won a gold and heaped praise on the son-of-the-soil for making India proud.\n\nPeople from far and wide have been reaching Neeraj’s house to congratulate them.\n\nSatish said his son developed interest in javelin from some of his associates in Panipat's Shivaji stadium.\n\n\"Later, he developed interest in the sport and he started doing well. He always focused only on javelin and remained firm on pursuing the sport,” he said.\n\nSatish said had he been alive, the legendary Milkha Singh would have been proud of his son.      \n\n\"We wish Milkha ji was alive and amongst us today, he would have been so happy and proud,\" he said.\n\nUncle Bhim added for the last 10 years Chopra had followed a strict diet but once he returns home the family will now let him relish his favourite dishes.\n\nOn Saturday, Chopra's family had put up a giant screen outside their home to enable all those from the neighbourhood, including children and a battery of mediapersons, who had gathered there, to watch the live action of his event from Tokyo.\n\nSatish said he was confident that his son would win a medal, but was not sure about the colour of the medal.\n\nChopra became the country's first gold-medallist in 13 years, his stupendous show making it the best ever Games for a nation starved for success at the grandest sporting spectacle.\n\nAt 23, he joined Abhinav Bindra in the select gold club but beat him on age as the latter was 25 when he claimed the top prize in the 2008 Beijing Games.\n\n—PTI\n\n",

    "postText": "Kolkata: An opinion piece in an RSS-linked Bengali magazine claims Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has been working along the lines of the BJP to ensure a “Congress-mukt Bharat”.\nThe article in ‘Swastika’, titled “Keno Itihas Muchte Chaichen Mamata, Shilpo Agroho na Sonia Khotom? (Why is Mamata trying to erase her history, is it to attract investment or to destroy Sonia)”, talks about Banerjee’s recent meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and her invitation to him to inaugurate the state government’s flagship investment conclave in April next year.\nThe column, written by one Nirmalya Mukhopadhyay and published Monday in the weekly magazine, also talks about Banerjee maintaining distance from Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her party.\nPointing out several recent statements by Banerjee against the UPA and Congress, a paragraph of the article reads: “Mamatar ei palte jaoa theke poriskar, ey Mamata shey Mamata noy. Narendra Modi er swapno Congress-mukt Bharat. Apaptoto Mamata sei sapner sharik bole amar dharona. Tai itihas muche phele swapner feriwalah Mamata (It is clear from her  changing stance that this is not the same Mamata. Narendra Modi’s dream is Congress-free India. I feel that Mamata now also believes in the same dream. That’s why she is erasing her history to sell this dream).”\nState minister and TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee said: “I don’t know who writes such articles. All I can say is that Mamata Banerjee is the main face against the BJP.”\nRSS state general secretary Jishnu Basu told The Indian Express: “I have not read the articles. Therefore I cannot comment on this. All I know is that about 62 workers of the BJP have been killed in post poll violence in West Bengal. This is nothing but the murder of democracy.”\nThis is not the first time the RSS-linked magazine has tried to link Banerjee and PM Modi’s paths. In the previous edition published on December 6, another article had talked about a “mysterious alliance between Modi and Mamata” which had caught Opposition parties off guard.\nSenior West Bengal Congress leader Amitabha Chakraborty said Banerjee’s recent activities vindicate the articles. “It is not the first time she has spoken against our party. She was with the BJP earlier and supported the NDA government. Now she is going against the Congress which is evident from her recent activities. It is clear that both Mamata and Modi wants to form the next government in 2024,” said Chakraborty.\nMagazine editor Tilak Ranjan Bera told The Indian Express: “It is the opinion of the columnist. He is a regular contributor to our magazine and is free to express his opinion. We are not drawing any conclusion as of yet. If anyone has any reservation against his column then they should challenge it with facts.”\nFormer editor of the magazine Bijoy Adhhya said: “The column is a reflection of contemporary politics. He has expressed his opinion after observing recent political activities.”\nOver the last few months, Banerjee has been distancing TMC from the Congress while reaching out to other Opposition parties.\nDuring her visit to New Delhi last month, Banerjee was cold to the Congress, deciding against meeting the Gandhis. She had then met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to invite him to inaugurate the Bengal Global Business Summit.\nThe Congress recently suffered another blow at the hands of the TMC, with Meghalaya witnessing a political upheaval. Former Chief Minister Mukul Sangma and 11 other Congress MLAs switched to the TMC, making it the principal Opposition party in the state.",

    "postText": "New Delhi: A Delhi court on Wednesday stayed the operation of an order directing Delhi Police to register an FIR against BJP leader Sambit Patra for allegedly posting a doctored video of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on social media, in which he was seen speaking about the farm laws.\nWhile hearing the revision petition of Patra, Additional Sessions Judge Sanjay Sharma of the Tis Hazari Court issued a notice in the matter saying the operation of the earlier order is stayed for the time being. In the revision petition, the BJP leader contended that the earlier court order failed to take into account the real meaning of manipulated media and equated the same with forgery. \"If any tweet is branded as manipulated media, it has one and simple meaning that the media is not authenticated one and it is for the persons who read it to rely upon it with caution,\" his plea stated.\nFurther hearing in the matter will be on January 10, 2022. The revision petition of Patra comes after Metropolitan Magistrate Rishabh Kapoor of Tis Hazari Court on November 23 ordered registration of FIR against him under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), allowing a complaint of Aam Aadmi Party's Atishi.\nAs per the petitioner, the accused fraudulently and knowingly forged the original video and uploaded the false, fabricated, and tampered video on social media with the only intention to incite members of the society against the complainant and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.\nThe plea stated that, since the complaint clearly disclosed the commission of a cognizable offence, it is the utmost duty of the police officials receiving the complaint to register an FIR under relevant provisions of law.\nEven otherwise, it is a settled law that whenever information is laid before the police officer regarding the commission of cognizable offence, the said police officer has no option but to immediately register an FIR, the plea read.\n\n—IANS",

    "postText": "New Delhi: Decorated air warrior Group Captain Varun Singh died at a military hospital in Bengaluru on Wednesday, a week after he was seriously injured in the chopper crash near Coonoor that killed Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat, his wife and 11 armed forces personnel.\nThe Indian Air Force said the 'braveheart' Group Captain succumbed to his injuries on Wednesday morning.\n\"IAF is deeply saddened to inform the passing away of braveheart Group Captain Varun Singh, who succumbed this morning to the injuries sustained in the helicopter accident on 08 Dec 21. IAF offers sincere condolences and stands firmly with the bereaved family,\" it said on Twitter. In August, Group Captain Singh was conferred with the Shaurya Chakra, India's third highest peacetime gallantry award after the Ashok Chakra and Kirti Chakra, for displaying exemplary composure and skill when his Tejas aircraft developed a technical snag during a sortie in October last year.\nThe 39-year-old Group Captain, who was known to be an excellent test pilot, is survived by an  11-year-old son, an eight-year-old daughter, and his wife. His father, Colonel (retd) KP Singh, had served in the Army Air Defence. The Group Captain's family originally hails from Ghazipur in Uttar Pradesh and now lives in Bhopal. He was admitted to a hospital in Wellington in Tamil Nadu with severe burn injuries on Wednesday last following the Mi-17V5 helicopter crash. A day later, he was shifted to the Command Hospital in Bengaluru from Wellington.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi expressed anguish at the passing away of Group Captain Singh, and said his rich service to the nation will never be forgotten. \"Group Captain Varun Singh served the nation with pride, valour and utmost professionalism. I am extremely anguished by his passing away. His rich service to the nation will never be forgotten. Condolences to his family and friends. Om Shanti,\" Modi tweeted. Describing the Group Captain as a \"true fighter\", Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said he fought till his last breath. \"Pained beyond words to learn of the demise of IAF pilot, Group Captain Varun Singh. He was a true fighter who fought till his last breath. My thoughts and deepest condolences are with his family and friends. We stand firmly with the family in this hour of grief,\" he said.\nGroup Captain Singh was on board the ill-fated Russian-made chopper as the liaison officer for the visit of Gen Rawat, India's senior-most military officer, to the Defence Services Staff College in Wellington. He was serving as an instructor at the prestigious institute for the last six months after a stint in the Tejas squadron. Group Captain Singh received Gen Rawat at the Sulur airbase from where the entourage was heading towards Wellington in the chopper that crashed. His Shaurya Chakra award citation said despite being in extreme physical and mental stress in a life-threatening situation, he maintained exemplary composure and recovered the aircraft, exhibiting exceptional flying skill.\n\"Faced with a potential hazard to his own life, he displayed extraordinary courage and skill to control and safely land the fighter aircraft saving hundreds of crore,\" it said. \"The pilot went beyond the call of duty and landed the aircraft taking calculated risks. This allowed an accurate analysis of fault on the indigenously designed fighter and further institution of preventive measures against recurrence,\" it said. Asked about his last rites, officials said the details will be finalised as per the wishes of his family.\n\n—PTI",

Aishwarya and others have been named in the case.\n\nIn 2016, the Panama Papers leak case came to the light in which Aishwarya and Bachchan family members were named. The names of Amitabh Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan also cropped up in the case.\n\nIn May 2005, a company was reportedly incorporated at British Virgin Island in which Aishwarya and other members of the Bachchan family were directors. In June 2005, her post was changed and she became a shareholder in the company.\n\nAfter three years, the company became inactive. later, after her name cropped up in the Panama Papers leak, an SIT was formed to probe the matter.\n\n--IANS",

    "postitle": "Eradication Of Illiteracy Should Become A People’s Movement: VP",
    "postText": "New Delhi (The Hawk): The Vice President, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today urged all stakeholders, including the private sector, to come forward and supplement the government’s work in the field of adult education and skills training. Stressing the need to make every adult literate, he also highlighted the need to focus on digital literacy and financial literacy among the masses.\nAddressing the gathering after presenting the prestigious Nehru and Tagore Literacy Awards in New Delhi today, the Vice President said that it was disappointing that despite making great progress in various fields like IT and digitization, India still has the largest number of illiterate persons in the world. Calling for urgent steps to address this challenge, he wanted the literacy drive to become a people’s movement. “Every educated youth in villages and colonies should come forward and teach at least one person from their localities or communities how to write and, how to operate digital devices and how to avail themselves of benefits of government schemes,” he said and termed it as their PSR – Personal Social Responsibility. ‘Each one-teach one’ should not merely remain a slogan, rather it should become a motivating force for the youth, he said.\nCalling for eradicating illiteracy in mission mode, Shri Naidu also advised the schools to encourage their students to begin adult education drives in their areas on weekends. “Students should be given some extra marks for such activities,” he said.\nPraising all awardees for their noteworthy contribution to the cause of adult education, the Vice President asked everyone to resolve to make India a fully literate and educated nation. “Literacy and education liberate people. They serve as the basic instruments of change and progress,” he said. Apart from illiteracy, he also emphasized the need to address various other challenges on priority such as poverty, urban-rural divide, social discrimination and gender discrimination.\nNoting that high rates of literacy are directly related to a country’s economic progress and the quality of life of its citizens, Shri Naidu suggested that in a developing country like India, literacy is even more important as it helps in better implementation and outcome of various developmental programs. Terming literacy as a precondition for skill education, the Vice President said that it not only instills confidence in a person but also helps in making one’s social life more active and dignified.\nAppreciating all stakeholders for India achieving near universal Gross Enrollment Ratio at Elementary Level, the Vice President expressed his happiness over the fact that Indian girls have higher school enrolment rate than boys at primary level. “We need to move forward from universal functional literacy to skill education and lifelong learning,” he added.\nPraising the New Education Policy- 2020 for its due emphasis on various aspects of adult education, Shri Naidu said that this approach opens new vistas of growth and development through availing lifelong opportunities of socio-economic and cultural development. “It recommends multiple avenues including crowd funding and utilizing online and app-based technology, satellite based television channels, online study resources and libraries for the development and promotion of adult education centers,” added.\nCongratulating the recipients of the Nehru and Tagore Literacy awards, the Vice President hoped that they would continue with their work to realize the vision of a ‘Shikshit aur Samarth Bharat’ – an Educated and Empowered India.\nIt may be noted that the Indian Adult Education Association (IAEA) has been conferring the Nehru Literacy Award since 1966 and Tagore Literacy Award since 1987 to individuals and institutions that have made noteworthy contributions to the field of education and national development. Prof. P. Adinarayana Reddy and Prof. M.C. Reddeppa Reddy were conferred with Nehru Literacy Awards for the year 2019 and 2020 respectively, whereas Prof. Anita Dighe and Smt. Nishat Farooq received Tagore Literacy Awards respectively for preceding two years. Prof. L. Raja, President, Indian Adult Education Association, Shri Suresh Khandelwal, General Secretary, IAEA, Shri K.C. Choudhary, Advisor, IAEA and others were present on the occasion.",

The Indian Navy played a pivotal role in the liberation and dedicating the ship's name to the maritime state of Goa will not just enhance the bonding between the Indian Navy and the people of Goa, but also link the ship's identity permanently to the crucial role the Navy played in nation-building. \nMormugao is being built at Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd (MDSL) as part of the Project 15B destroyers. The ship incorporates several niche indigenous technologies and is a shining example of Atma Nirbhar Bharat. She has provided thrust and impetus to the 'Make in India' initiative. \nMormugao will add significantly to the Indian Navy’s combat capabilities. With the recent commissioning in November 2021 of INS Visakhapatnam and the fourth P75 submarine INS Vela, commencement of sea trials of Mormugao is testimony to the cutting-edge capabilities of MDSL and the strong indigenous shipbuilding tradition of a modern and vibrant India.",

    "postText": "New Delhi: As elections to the Punjab Assembly near, the Aam aadmi Party (AAP) has intensified its attacks on the Congress government in the state.\nBarely decade old, the AAP has taken on the century-old Indian National Congress, which won the 17th Lok Sabha elections with a majority in 2019. The Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party is focussing on two subjects — education and illegal sand mining — in its fight against the Congress.\nIt all started with Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia’s visit to a primary government school in Punjab’s Chakalan village followed by another visit to Makrauna Kalan — the village of Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s maternal grandfather in his Chamkaur Sahib Assembly seat.\nThere, Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio in Delhi government saw the dilapidated condition of the schools and said that if the Punjab government deems itself to have the best education system  then it is lying and messing up with the future of millions of children and thereby, that of the country’s. Both he and Punjab Education Minister Pargat Singh indulged in a war of words over the issue with the former challenging the latter to present a list of 250 schools within 24 hours that have undergone major reforms in terms of good infrastructure, enhanced curriculum, teacher training programmes and showed improved results under the Congress regime.\n“Punjab has the right to know the Congress party’s contribution in the field of education in the state in the last five years,” the AAP leader had said while releasing the list. The Punjab minister, on the other hand, failed to provide the list, giving the Delhi-based party a golden opportunity to show its mettle on the subject. Since coming into power in Delhi in 2015, the AAP-led Delhi government has transformed the education system of the union territory. The pass percentage of the 2016 batch of grade 12 CBSE students under the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government was 85.9 per cent. In 2017, it improved to 88.2 per cent; it then leapt from 90.6 per cent in 2018 to 94.24 per cent in 2019 to 97.8 per cent in July 2020. In fact, the government school results in Delhi reported a surge of 5.9 per cent in comparison to the private schools in Delhi.\nWe achieved such a great result by improving school infrastructure, focusing on quality learning, investing in teachers by sending them for training to Cambridge University which opened their eyes to the global scale of teaching, involving parents in their child’s development journey and introducing curriculums that helped children look within themselves and to understand the world in a better way via Happiness, Business Blaster and Deshbhakti Curriculum,” Manish Sisodia told media repeatedly.\nEarlier on November 27, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal reached Mohali where he met contractual teachers, who were protesting for the regularisation of their services and said, “When AAP forms government in Punjab, like Delhi, all the issues of the teachers here will also be resolved,” further alleging that both Akali Dal and Congress had 10 and eight years in government respectively, but neither did anything for the teachers.\nThe AAP national convener made eight promises to the teachers guaranteeing them of changing the future of Punjab with good governance. He promised them that once in power in the state all outsourcing and contractual teachers would be made permanent. He told them if the Channi government does not accept the demands of the striking teachers, then he (Kejriwal) will join them in their dharna. Kejriwal also promised them that a transparent transfer policy in Punjab will be implemented and non-teaching work burden will be taken off the teachers’ shoulders, all vacancies will be filled, teachers will be sent abroad for training, promotion policy will be introduced and cashless medical facilities to teachers and their families will be provided. On December 4, AAP MLA, who is also the party Punjab Co-in-charge, Raghav Chadha alleged that illegal sand mining was being carried out in Chamkaur Sahib, Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s constituency under the former’s patronage. He tweeted along with a live video of sand being mined illegally, “Illegal sand mining in Charanjit Singh Channi constituency has been exposed. It is the biggest expose which will shake Punjab’s politics.” “We are in Jindapur village, which is in the chief minister’s constituency Chamkaur Sahib. Illegal sand mining is going on here openly. Sand is being illegally carried in trucks,” it added.\nChadha also wrote a letter to the forest officer on November 22. “Forest Range officer Rajwant Singh had informed Sub divisional Magistrate, Sri Chamkaur Sahib – about the illegal mining activities in CM Charanjit Channi’s constituency. There was no action on the sand mafia, but Rajwant Singh soon received transfer orders,” he tweeted.\nChadha on Friday said that the AAP will reward Rs 25,000 to the Punjab Chief Minister if he acts against every site where illegal sand mining is being done as he has complete information about the whereabouts of illegal mining in his state. In response, Charanjit Singh Channi attacked Arvind Kejriwal by calling him a “power greedy outsider”, who wants to rule the state and accused him of misleading the people of Punjab. “AAP supremo has little knowledge about the state and he was groping in the dark for fulfilling his lust of power,” he added. Channi had also retweeted a blurred letter in Gurumukhi on his Twitter account saying that AAP can spread as many lies as it wants, but people of Punjab know the truth.\nIllegal sand mining has become a major political issue in Punjab along with the problem of liquor, and in view of this the Congress government recently introduced “Mission Clean”.\nEarlier this year, a Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader too had captured the act of illegal sand mining in a Facebook live that showed trucks loading sand at the Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Plant. The opposition party had blamed Congress leader and State Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal and his brother-in-law Jaijeet Singh Johal of being involved in illegal sand mining. Punjab is headed for the Assembly elections in early 2022. In 2017 Aam Aadmi Party emerged as the second-largest party winning 20 seats in the 117-member Punjab legislative Assembly.",

He flagged off Jan Vishwas Yatra from Uttar Pradesh's Ambedkar Nagar on Sunday.

    "postitle": "Delimitation Comm: 6 Seats For Jammu, 1 For Kashmir",
    "postText": "New Delhi: The Delimitation Commission on Jammu and Kashmir has proposed six additional assembly seats for Jammu region and one for Kashmir while reserving 16 constituencies for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, triggering strong protests from parties such as the National Conference which accused the commission of allowing the \"political agenda of the BJP to dictate its recommendations\".\nThe PDP, JK Apni Party and the People's Conference (PC), which is regarded as being friendly towards the BJP, also protested strongly against the commission's draft recommendations which will alter the electoral map of Jammu and Kashmir.\nThe Kashmir division currently has 46 seats and Jammu 37 seats.\nThe commission headed by former Supreme Court judge Ranjana Desai held its second meeting here on Monday. It has five Lok Sabha members from Jammu and Kashmir as associate members and Chief Election Commissioner Sushil Chandra as ex-officio member.\nThree Lok Sabha members of the NC, including party president and former chief minister Farooq Abdullah, attended the commission meeting for the first time. Two BJP MPs, including Minister of State in the PMO Jitendra Singh, were also present.\nSources said that the parties have been asked to submit their views on the proposed increase of seats by December 31.\nAbdullah, who is also the chairman of the five-party People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), said after the meeting that he would brief the grouping as well as his party colleagues of the deliberations of the commission.\n\"We attended the meeting for the first time because we wanted the voice of people of Jammu and Kashmir to be heard. The meeting took place in cordial manner and we all were explained the method adopted for coming to the conclusion,\" Abdullah said.\n\"I will discuss with my senior party leaders before sending our views to the commission. We have also not been told about the seats that they are reserving for Schedule Castes and Schedule Tribes,\" he said.\nIn a strong reaction, NC vice president and former chief minister Omar Abdullah tweeted that it was deeply disappointing that the commission appears to have allowed the political agenda of the BJP to dictate its recommendations rather than data which should have been its only consideration.\n\"Contrary to the promised 'scientific approach', it's a political approach,\" he said.        (Contd On P2)\nHe said the draft recommendation of the Delimitation Commission \"is unacceptable. The distribution of newly created assembly constituencies with six going to Jammu and only one to Kashmir is not justified by the data of the 2011 census.\"\nThe Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party, headed by former minister Altaf Bukahri, also rejected the proposal of the commission. \"This is outright unacceptable to us. Apni Party demands a fair delimitation exercise without any bias, taking population and districts as the base. We strongly demand the Government of India to intervene,\" it said. PDP president and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti said the commission has been \"created simply to serve BJP's political interests by dividing people along religious and regional lines. The real game plan is to install a government in JK which will legitimise the illegal and unconstitutional decisions of August 2019\". She was referring to the government's decisions of abrogating Jammu and Kashmir's special status under Article 370 and bifurcating the erstwhile state into union territories. \"My apprehensions about the Delimitation Commission weren't misplaced. They want to pitch people against each other by ignoring the population census and proposing six seats for one region and only one for Kashmir,\" she said. People's Conference chief Sajjad Lone said the recommendations of the commission were totally unacceptable. \"They reek of bias. What a shock for those who believe in democracy,\" he tweeted.\nThe commission has proposed nine seats for STs and seven for SCs in Jammu and Kashmir, sources said. The Delimitation Commission was set up in February 2020 after the passage of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill in Parliament in August 2019. Initially, it was asked to complete its work within a year but had to be given an extension of one year in March this year as the work could not be completed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The commission is tasked with redrawing parliamentary and assembly constituencies in the union territory. Prime minister Narendra Modi, during a meeting with Jammu and Kashmir leaders on June 24, had said the ongoing delimitation exercise has to happen quickly so that polls can be held to install an elected government that gives strength to its development trajectory. In a series of tweets after a three-and-a-half-hour-long meeting with 14 political leaders of Jammu and Kashmir, the prime minister said, \"Our priority is to strengthen grassroots democracy in JK. Delimitation has to happen at a quick pace so that polls can happen and JK gets an elected Government that gives strength to JK's development trajectory.\" On June 23 this year, the commission had held a meeting that was attended by all the 20 deputy commissioners of Jammu and Kashmir where inputs were gathered on how to make the assembly seats more geographically compact. Twenty-four seats of the assembly continue to remain vacant as they fall under Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).\n\n—PTI",

    "postText": " Ashok ChatterjeeKolkata (The Hawk):\n\nArticle 167 defines a chief minister’s duties towards the governor of a state.\n\nThe tweet from the Raj Bhavan read: “Constrained to invoke Article 167 of the Constitution to seek @MamataOfficial all record and proceedings leading to Inquiry Commission #Pegasus Notification dated 26.07.2021 as the Chief Secretary Hari Krishna Dwivedi @IASassociation failed to provide such information.”\n\nThe governor had directed the chief minister to take steps to forward the entire record leading to the constitution of the Pegasus inquiry commission at the earliest.\n\nOn December 17, a CJI-led Supreme Court bench had stayed its judicial inquiry into the controversy. The bench was hearing a plea filed by NGO Global Village Foundation against the state government’s notification to constitute a judicial commission in this regard.\n\nThe state government had on July 26 constituted a commission of inquiry headed by former Supreme Court Justice Madan Lakur and former Calcutta High Court Justice Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya into the Pegasus case. On Friday, the Raj Bhavan tweet said that the governor had asked the chief secretary for a notice to form a commission to investigate Pegasus on July 26 and other documents. It has been clearly asked to pay by December 18.\n\nWhen the state chief secretary and home secretary met Dhankhar at Raj Bhavan on December 11 they were reminded of the matter. But even after that, the governor received no such information. In his tweet on Wednesday he said that the state government would have to send the documents and notification regarding the formation and notification of the inquiry commission by Thursday.\n\nA commission headed by retired Justice Lokur was constituted under the Inquiry Act (1952). That commission had already started its work. The Raj Bhavan had sent the official notification and related documents on December 6. The governor alleged that top officials of the state administration did not listen to him, hence, on Friday he sent a message asking for documents again.\n\nIn an unrelated development, the governor tweeted about his displeasure on the private universities and rescheduled his meeting with them on December 23, instead of Monday.\n\n“Taking exception to stance of Pvt. Univ Chancellors & VCs @AdamasUniversi1 @AmityUni @BrainwareTweet @jis_university @TnuEdu @E_Learning_SSU @snuindia @sxukolkata @svu_official @IIC_TIU @csatyajit that they will not attend Dec 20 meeting Governor has rescheduled meeting for Dec23” wrote the governor.\n\nHe further said in his tweet that the tenor and content of communication, indicates worrisome unionism at @AdamasUniversi1 @AmityUni @BrainwareTweet @jis_university @TnuEdu @E_Learning_SSU @snuindia @sxukolkata @svu_official @IIC_TIU @csatyajit bearing out all pervasive fear & authoritarian governance @MamataOfficial.",

    "postText": "Mumbai: Rising domestic Covid-19 cases, along with that of crude oil prices as well as expectations of rising inflation, dragged Indian equity market indices lower for the fifth consecutive session.\n\nBesides, subdued global markets and re-allocation of foreign funds out of India further dented investors' sentiments.\n\nOn Monday, the India Volatility Index rose the most in two months ending 14.5 per cent higher at 25.47.\n\nThis spooked FIIs who turned net sellers to the tune of Rs 893.25 crore in the BSE, the NSE and the MSEI in the capital market segment.\n\nGlobally, Asian stocks ended mostly lower amidst lingering worries about inflation, high valuations and worries over policy tightening. Similarly, European markets opened lower as caution over sharply rising inflation, outweighed increasing optimism over the vaccine rollout programme, and the path to an economic reopening. On the domestic front, 10 Year Gsec yields touched a 6 month high of 6.19 per cent.\n\nThe S&P BSE Sensex closed at 49,744.32, down 1,145.44 points, or 2.25 per cent, from its previous close of 50,889.76 points.\n\nThe Nifty50 on the National Stock Exchange closed at 14,675.70, lower by 306.05 points, or 2.04 per cent.\n\n\"Nifty has fallen 5 per cent from its all time high in about 5 sessions. Indian equities came under selling pressure due to cautious trade in markets abroad, slowing FPI inflows, profit taking and breach of key technical levels,\" said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities. \"Rising crude oil prices that could impact the macros and inflation and rising 10 year Gsec yields were the key local factors that shook the equity markets.\"\n\nSiddhartha Khemka, Head, Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said: \"Global cues were weak as yields on the benchmark US 10-year Treasury notes rose to a one-year high, thus worrying investors that money might move away from emerging markets.\"\n\n\"Further, there were concerns over the risk of higher inflation due to sharp jump in commodity prices which tempered optimism around a vaccine-led economic recovery.\" Khemka added that a sudden spike in VIX along with sustained selling pressure has caused the fear and worry about further profit booking led to a decline in the market. \"Going ahead the market may continue with its profit booking for some time till the concerns over rising bond yields and inflation recedes.\"\n\nVinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said: \"Rising economic restrictions from spike in virus cases and weak global cues hit the domestic market sentiment. The rate of market fall was aggravated by a sharp rise in volatility, being a monthly F&O expiry week.\"\n\n\"FPI inflows which was leading the rally slowed down due to global vulnerabilities from rising bond yield and inflation. However, this is a buy on dip market, a short-term correction will trigger new buying, as economic fundamentals have improved, with more focus on industrial and cyclicals.\" —IANS\n\n",

    "postText": "Bihar Railway Exam Agitation: Who Is Khan Sir?\n",
    "description": "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Patna:&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Patna-based tutor and YouTuber, Khan Sir has been in the eye of a storm for allegedly inciting student protests against the format of tests being conducted by the Railway Recruitment Board for a bunch of jobs called – Non-Technical Popular Categories (RRB NTPC).</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Khan Sir is famous for coaching for various competitive examinations using YouTube and digital media to reach out to students. He also runs a popular coaching centre in Patna by the name of ‘Khan GS Research Centre’ and is famous for his unique teaching style.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">He has never revealed his real name and most people know him by just the short sobriquet – Khan Sir.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Earlier, some people claimed on social media that his name was Amit Singh. However, some also claimed that his name is Faisal Khan and he was a resident of Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Whenever he was asked about his real name, the YouTuber said that the coaching institute he is associated with has refused to divulge any details about his real name or personal contact details.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The authorities in Bihar have registered an FIR against Khan Sir and five teachers for allegedly inciting violence over the controversy surrounding the results of tests conducted by the RRB-NTPC after recent violent protests in Patna.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The FIR against Khan Sir and others was registered on the basis of statements given by agitating students who were detained on Monday and Tuesday in Patna.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">They purportedly said they were motivated to participate in violent protests after a video, in which Khan Sir allegedly instigated students to agitate on the streets if the RRB NTPC exams were not cancelled, went viral on social media.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The FIR stated that, on the basis of statements and video clippings accessed by the police, it is evident that “agitating students along with coaching institute owners plotted a conspiracy to carry out large-scale violence in Patna to threaten law and order”.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The job aspirants had blocked the New Delhi-Kolkata main railway tracks and some others protested in Bihar’s Arrah and Sharif Railway station. Hundreds of angry protesters also allegedly set ablaze a train in Bihar’s Arrah.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">After the violence broke on Monday, Khan Sir apparently released a video appealing to students to carry out their protests in a peaceful manner. He said that if they turned towards violence, no one would support them. Khan Sir, along with other teachers, released another video on Thursday and told the students that there was no point protesting as the Union Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has already assured that there would be no second examination for those who have applied for Group D posts, and the results of RRB NTPC-CBT-I would also be revised.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Khan Sir, was seen quoting a tweet of former Bihar Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi in which the latter talks about his conversation with the Union Railway Minister.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The result for the RRB-NTPC exam 2021 was announced on January 15. These protests soon took a violent turn as the candidates squatted on railway tracks, set a train on fire and pelted stones at different places in the state.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The Railways also said that all students found involved in vandalism and unlawful activities during these protests shall be barred from future recruitment.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">However, before the FIR was registered against him, the YouTuber had told media persons that ‘he should be arrested if he has a role to play in the violence that unfolded during these protests’.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">He also went onto hold the RRB responsible for the violence as they gave the same test to both intermediate and graduate students. He contended this benefitted the graduate students vis-a-vis the intermediate students.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Khan Sir is not new to controversy. Before this, many controversial video clips of his have gone viral.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Recently, he released a video explaining possible ‘security lapse’ during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s January 5 visit to Ferozepur in Punjab. He had said in his video, “the PM’s convoy took the road to the National Martyrs Memorial in Hussainiwala since weather conditions did not allow his chopper to take off. The incident was a big security lapse as protestors were given access to the PM’s route while the route clearing team of security personnel gave assurances to SPG that the route is clear”.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">He also held senior officials of the SPG responsible and said it was a major lapse to allow the PM’s cavalcade to remain halted on a flyover for nearly half an hour. He sought to know what stopped the NSG from reversing the cavalcade from the spot which was a vulnerable flyover near the Pakistan border.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Last year, he had grabbed the limelight for his video on France-Pakistan relations. In the video, ‘Khan Sir’ was allegedly seen making an Islamophobic statement while talking about mass protests that took place in Pakistan between April 11-20. This debate had sparked social media speculation about his real identity.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Meanwhile, several political parties in Bihar have come in support of Khan Sir. Former state Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, who heads the NDA constituent- Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), has demanded withdrawal of cases registered against Khan Sir.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Manjhi on Thursday said that such a step can further intensify the students’ agitation. “FIRs against teachers like Khan Sir could provoke students for more undeclared agitations in Bihar. The time has come for the governments to talk on unemployment and come-out with a solution”, he said.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Similarly, Jan Adhikar Party leader Pappu Yadav also came support of Khan Sir and said the oppression of students and teachers must stop. He said, “It is unfortunate that teachers are being targeted in the RRB-NTPC agitation case”.—PTI</span></p>",

    "postText": "China 'Concerned' Over India's Business Environment Amid Tax Probes On Chinese Firms",
    "description": "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">New Delhi:&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">China has expressed concern over the business environment in India as Indian authorities conduct 'irregular' tax audits, Global Times reported. China has urged India to provide a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese enterprises.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Gao Feng, spokesperson for the Ministry of Commerce in China, made the comment during a routine press conference in Beijing on Thursday.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"China has contributed to Indian economic development, and created a large number of local jobs, and we hope India can provide a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese businesses,\" Gao said. The Finance Ministry in India issued a statement on January 5, saying that Chinese smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi's local company in India had engaged in \"tax evasion\" and demanded that it pay a total of Rs 6.53 billion ($88 million) in taxes owed between April 2017 and June 2020.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Xiaomi denied the claim, saying that company adheres to legal and compliant operations around the world and abides with the relevant laws and regulations of each jurisdiction in which it operates, the report said. Xiaomi said in a statement sent to the Global Times on January 5 that the Indian authorities are asking it to pay back the import taxes on the royalty and licence fees that are not related to Xiaomi's current business, adding that the official statement from the Indian authorities is not a final decision. Indian tax authorities launched a broad investigation into Chinese companies operating in India on tax and income issues in December last year, including Chinese mobile companies Oppo, Xiaomi and OnePlus. Chinese mobile phone brands are highly popular in the Indian market, and their market share far exceeds that of local Indian brands. Xiaomi led the Indian smartphone market shipments in the third quarter of 2021, holding a 22 percent share, as per Counterpoint's latest research. The total Indian smartphone shipments crossed 52 million units in the third quarter with Xiaomi on top, according to gadgets.ndtv.com.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Counterpoint's latest report on Indian smartphone shipments in the third quarter of FY22 shows that Xiaomi, Samsung, Vivo, Realme and Oppo were the top performing brands, in that order. Yang Yishuang, a deputy professor from Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times earlier that such \"unjustifiable\" suppression for the purpose of protecting domestic industries in India may affect the confidence of Chinese companies to further expand investment in the Indian market, the report said.</span></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">New Delhi (The Hawk):&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Union Minister for Chemicals and Fertilizers Shri Mansukh Mandaviya today launched NIPER Research Portal along with Shri Bhagwanth Khuba, Minister of State for Chemicals and Fertilizers in presence of Dr V. K Paul, Member (Health), Niti Aayog. National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER) Research Portal has been created with the aim to disseminate the information about all the NIPERs and their research activities, patents filed and Publication information at one place so that a industry and other stakeholders know about them.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Reiterating the vision of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan and Jai Anusandhaan, Dr Mansukh Mandaviya said that Research &amp; Development is one of the crucial pillars for a country's economy. He said that we need to harness this energy of aspirations of all stakeholders and create a holistic ecosystem. Our expertise in generics can also be further expanded to other sectors, he added.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Pointing towards the importance of healthy competition both in Industry and Academia, the Union Minister noted that competition and demand is a necessity of research and innovation as this promotes quality ideas and solutions for our citizens. He stressed that Research and Innovation is a necessity for the sustained growth of pharmaceuticals sector.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The Minister stated that the country already has young talent and human resources, but we need to channelize them effectively through Industry-Academia cooperation. To enhance this industry–Academia collaboration, the Department of Pharmaceuticals has created this Research Portal to capture the research activities of all seven NIPERs, he informed. He said that that the platform inaugurated today would help us in promoting this synergy and would be a boon for our industries, especially the MSME sector.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Shri&nbsp;Bhagwanth Khuba said India is the third-largest pharmaceutical manufacturing country and our vaccine development story is an example of effective cooperation among stakeholders.&nbsp;He said that the platform will track the research and tasks of all NIPERS. He further said that the Government is committed to promote research and innovation and this portal is a step in that direction.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Dr VK Paul recollected the key role played by NIPERs in India's health ecosystem. He requested the government to streamline the funding pipeline and expedite the budgets allocated. He urged the industry to provide support like the NIPERs research fund for priority areas. He also encouraged NIPERs to create a vibrant scientific community by engaging with stakeholders and mobilizing ideas of the young generation, promoting academic autonomy and delivering on their research goals.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Accentuating the importance of NIPER’s Research Program, which focuses on the needs of the hour, the Secretary, Department of Pharmaceuticals, Ms S. Aparna said that the importance of Research and Innovation has never been more important and more apparent than in the last two years of the global pandemic. We have seen the need for new drugs, re-purposed drugs, safer drugs, more efficacious drugs and the most affordable drugs to help mankind, she added.&nbsp;Shri highlighted that the portal will promote research work that is more relevant to the current evolving need of the sector and the requirements of the patient community.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The purpose of this portal is to authenticate availability of the research work that is ongoing. It will help other researchers and especially the industry to get in touch with the relevant organization so that they can work together and make the research more purposeful and meaningful. For long, research institutes have been working in silos or isolation. The research portal will try to bring together research institutions spread across different departments within government and also these institutions with industries. The Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers also requested all relevant research institutions like the Department of Biotechnology, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Ministry of AYUSH, ICMR etc., and even DRDO, where a lot of pharmaceuticals sector-related research takes place to join this portal.</span></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">New Delhi:&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The researchers from IIT Jodhpur have developed an automated Artificial Intelligence (AI) solution for COVID-19 prediction from chest X-rays.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The experiment was performed with more than 2,500 chest X-ray images and achieved about 96.80 per cent sensitivity.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The statement issued by IIT Jodhpur said that the researchers at IIT Jodhpur have proposed a deep learning-based algorithm called COMiT-Net, which learns the abnormalities present in the chest X-ray images to differentiate between a COVID-19 affected lung and a non-COVID affected lung.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"The developed AI algorithm not only predicts whether the CXR has COVID-19 pneumonia or not, but it is also capable of identifying the infected regions in the lungs, thus making them explainable,\" IIT Jodhpur stated.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">While there have been numerous research studies in COVID-19 detection using X-ray or CT scans in the past years, most of them fail to provide an explainable solution. The uniqueness of this research is the proposed study which can visually showcase the region which is infected.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The technique interprets only from the lung region. According to IIT Jodhpur, the Artificial Intelligence solution used in this research is explainable from both algorithmic and medical points of view.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The team that contributed to this research are Aakarsh Malhotra, Visiting Research Scholar at IIT Jodhpur, Surbhi Mittal, PhD Scholar, Computer Science, IIT Jodhpur, Puspita Majumdar, Visiting Research Scholar at IIT Jodhpur, Saheb Chhabra, Visiting Research Scholar at IIT Jodhpur, Kartik Thakral, PhD Scholar, Computer Science, IIT Jodhpur, Mayank Vatsa, Professor, Computer Science, IIT Jodhpur, Richa Singh, Professor and Head of Department, Computer Science, IIT Jodhpur, Santanu Chaudhury, Professor and Director, IIT Jodhpur, Ashwin Pudrod, Consultant Pulmonologist, Ashwini Hospital and Ramakant Heart Care Centre, India, Anjali Agrawal, Consultant Radiologist, TeleRadiology Solutions, India.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">A research paper on this project has been published in the journal \"Pattern Recognition (Volume 122)\". The research is part of the RAKSHAK project under NM-CPS DST and iHuB Drishti at IIT Jodhpur. The researchers aim at developing a full-scale prototype through the knowledge learnt in this project. —ANI</span></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Mumbai (The Hawk):</strong>&nbsp;A bountiful bust needs special care, and by that, we mean great support at all hours. One cannot stress the importance of a good side support bra in your closet. A side support bra will not just keep your breasts from jiggling up and down or side to side, but also keep you much more comfortable than a regular bra.</p><p><br></p><p>In a nutshell, get the right coverage and support while sprucing up the overall appearance of your bust. Let us help you learn more about these unsung heroes in a world of bras, and familiarize you with their various benefits.</p><p><br></p><p>What is a Side Support Bra?</p><p><br></p><p>As the name suggests, the prime functionality of a Side Support Bra is to support the sides of your breasts. You can expect to minimize at least 2 inches of your breasts when you wear one of these bras.</p><p><br></p><p>Are you having a hard time wearing a button down shirt or a fitted top just because you are never able to achieve that perfectly shaped look? Or, maybe that unwanted side spillage of your breasts is keeping you away from achieving a perfectly smooth appearance? In that case, all you need is a Side Support Bra.</p><p><br></p><p>A side support bra is designed to function exactly as its name suggests: to support the sides of your breasts, to prevent them from spilling</p><p><br></p><p>These bras are designed with inbuilt shaper panels or slings that help in achieving a more defined look by pushing the bust in.</p><p><br></p><p>Extra side coverage eliminates underarm bulge lending a smooth appearance under any outfit.</p><p><br></p><p>Benefits of a Side Support Bra</p><p><br></p><p>Get a fuller and rounder look – Side Support Bras are designed with inbuilt shaper panels or slings that help in achieving a more defined look by pushing your bust in. These shaper panels place your breast tissues proportionately and eventually give your bust a fuller and rounder shape.</p><p><br></p><p>Flaunt a sleek silhouette – Now that your breast tissues are placed properly, you have to ensure that your tissues do not slip off towards the sides and create unwanted bulges. This is where side boning comes to the rescue. Side Support Bras being the best bra for lift and side support keep your sides firm by pushing the tissues towards the front. The side coverage in these bras also eliminates your underarm bulge lending a smooth appearance under any outfit. This helps you achieve an overall sleek and neat silhouette.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Get a desirable forward projection – Side Support Bras feature broad side wings that provide a secure fit. This doubly ensures zero side spillage. Your breasts get a desirable forward projection and look super attractive.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Stay comfortable all day long – Wide shoulder straps in a bra are a saviour for heavy-breasted women. Thin straps tend to create a lot of pressure on your shoulders and you may end up suffering from intensive pain. A Side Support Bra comes with wide straps that holds your chest firmly and gives you a perfect lift without causing any pain.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember ladies, it is very important to stay true to your size when choosing a Side Support Bra. The wrong size can cause side spillage, back rolls or painful marks from those poking shoulder straps. So, do not compromise on finding your exact measurements before buying the best full cup bra for side support.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">New Delhi (The Hawk):&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">&nbsp;India has emerged as the largest exporter of gherkins in the world. India has exported cucumber and gherkins to the tune of 1,23,846 Metric Tonnes with a value of USD 114 million during April-October, 2021.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">India has crossed the USD 200 million mark of export of agricultural processed product, - pickling cucumber, which is globally referred as gherkins or cornichons, in the last financial year.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">In 2020-21, India had shipped 2,23,515 Metric Tonnes of cucumber and gherkins with a value of USD 223 million.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Following directions of the Department of Commerce, Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry, the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) undertook a series of initiatives in infrastructure development, product promotion in the global market and adherence to food safety management system in processing units.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Gherkins are exported under two categories -- cucumbers and gherkins, which are prepared and preserved by vinegar or acetic acid and cucumbers and gherkins, which are provisionally preserved.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Gherkin cultivation, processing and exports started in India during the early 1990s with a modest beginning in Karnataka and later extended to the neighbouring states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Nearly 15% production of the world’s gherkin requirement is grown in India.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Gherkins is currently exported to more than 20 countries, with major destinations being North America, European countries and Oceanic countries such as USA, France, Germany, Australia, Spain, South Korea, Canada, Japan, Belgium, Russia, China, Sri Lanka and Israel.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Apart from its export potential, the gherkin industry plays a key role in the creation of rural employment. In India, cultivation of gherkins is carried out under contract farming by around 90,000 small and marginal farmers with an annual production area of 65,000 acres.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Processed gherkins are exported in bulk as industrial raw material and in jars as ready to eat. The bulk production is still occupying a high percentage of the gherkin market. In India there are about 51 major companies producing and exporting gherkins in drums and ready-to-eat consumer packs.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">APEDA has played a significant role in promotion of export of processed vegetables and it has been providing financial assistance for development of infrastructure and enhancing quality of processed gherkins, products promotion in the international market and implementation of food safety management systems in the processing units. On an average, a gherkin farmer produces 4 metric tonne per acre per crop and earns about Rs 80,000 with a net income of Rs 40,000. Gherkin has a 90-day crop and the farmers take two crops annually. Processing plants of international standards have been established here to cater to the requirement of foreign buyers.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">All the gherkin manufacturing and exporting companies are either ISO, BRC, IFS, FSSC 22000 certified and HACCP certified or possess all the certifications.&nbsp;Many of the Companies have adopted Social Audits.&nbsp;This ensures all statutory benefits are given to the Employees.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The APEDA is also focusing on value addition of gherkins to increase the export value of the product.</span></p>",

The subsequent phases are envisaged to encourage innovation and to provide incubation support for the solutions to the grass-root problem statements in the affordable and clean-energy domain.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">A welcome and brief introduction to the center was given by&nbsp;</span><strong style=\"color: black;\">Prof. SRM Prasanna,&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"color: black;\">Dean (R&amp;D), IIT Dharwad</span><strong style=\"color: black;\">.</strong><span style=\"color: black;\">&nbsp;He mentioned that India is blessed with many renewable energy sources like solar, wind, biomass, and such affordable technologies for clean energy can be developed and optimized, which will precisely be the scope of this center.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong style=\"color: black;\">Prof. K. VijayRaghavan</strong><span style=\"color: black;\">&nbsp;mentioned that energy and energy solutions are a critical part of the adaptation and mitigation of climate change. He added that in the past two decades, there has been an enormous increase in the research on Solar, Wind, Nuclear, and other forms of energy and the results of such research are yet to come to the market more effectively. IIT Dharwad will be one of the very few institutions in the country which is joining hands with industry partners such as Honeywell in training the young generation to address the complex problems of mitigation and adaptation to climate change. As the global temperature rises, there are big challenges ahead in high temperature and high humidity areas which make people dysfunctional. Secondly, energy availability for farming is another big challenge, further energy availability for the health sector, education sector with 24x7 accessible education for all are some of the important challenges that this GCoE needs to address. Finally, he added, the Government has launched a hydrogen mission and one of the objectives is to use the energy required for its generation from clean energy sources such as solar and wind energy hence calling it green hydrogen energy. The center’s research &amp; development efforts may go in that direction too. With these points, the PSA to Govt. of India congratulated all the stakeholders IIT Dharwad, Honeywell, and SELCO Foundation for establishing one of its kind GCoE in Affordable and Clean Energy.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong style=\"color: black;\">Shri Vinayak Chatterjee,&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"color: black;\">Chairman Board of Governors, IIT Dharwad,</span><strong style=\"color: black;\">&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"color: black;\">mentioned that the launch of the Global Center of Excellence in Affordable and Clean Energy is a historical milestone for IIT Dharwad. The center proposes to put the academic involvements, research &amp; developments in the lab for field tests in the countryside. The work at the center would make a long-lasting impact on the daily lives of our country at large. “Honeywell is committed to creating solutions to help communities meet challenges in energy, water, and air. Our partnership with IIT Dharwad seeks to find affordable and sustainable technology-driven solutions in clean energy for the betterment of our rural communities. This also dovetails with the Government’s goal of meeting 50% of the country’s energy requirement from renewables by 2030,” said&nbsp;</span><strong style=\"color: black;\">Ashish Gaikwad</strong><span style=\"color: black;\">, President, Honeywell India, and Director, HHHSIF.&nbsp;</span><strong style=\"color: black;\">Prof. P.

In that spirit, the provision for nomination for Family Pension is intended to avoid any hassle to the child suffering from a mental disability in obtaining Guardianship Certificate from the Court or in claiming Family Pension after the death of his/her parents. Therefore, he said, insisting for a Guardianship Certificate by a Bank in such cases defeats the very purpose of such nomination and also amounts to violation of the statutory provisions of Central Civil Service (Pension) Rules, 2021.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">The Department has, therefore, reiterated the provisions of the above rules. CMDs of all Pension Disbursing Banks have been advised to issue suitable instructions to their CPPCs/Pension Paying Branches for payment of Family Pension in respect of a mentally retarded child through the person nominated by the Government servant/Pensioner/ Family Pensioner in accordance with the statutory provisions of the Rules and not to insist for a Guardianship Certificate issued by Court of Law in such cases.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Pertinent to mention that in recent months, the Department of Pensions has introduced a number of path breaking reforms including relaxation in the provision of Family Pension for divorced daughters, introduction of Face Recognition Technology through mobile app for ease in submitting Life Certificate by elderly pensioners, Electronic Pension Pay Order, assistance from Postal Department to facilitate pension process etc.</span></p><p><br></p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>New Delhi (The Hawk):</strong> The President of India Shri Ram Nath Kovind addressed the joint sitting of the two Houses of Parliament, here today.&nbsp;The President, in his address, highlighted the various initiatives taken by the Central Government for women empowerment, to provide them new opportunities for employment&nbsp;and&nbsp;equal participation in various fields.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">In his address the President said “Women are playing an increasingly important role in providing impetus to rural economy. Banks have extended financial help to the tune of Rupees 65,000 crore to more than 28 lakh Self-Help Groups in 2021-22. This is four times the amount extended in 2014-15. The government has also provided training to thousands of members of the women self-help groups and made them partners as ‘Banking Sakhi’. These women are delivering banking services to rural households at the doorsteps”.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The President stated “Women’s empowerment is one of the top priorities of my government. We are all witness to the success of Ujjwala Yojana. Entrepreneurship and skills of the mothers and sisters of our country have been promoted through the \"Mudra\" scheme. “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao” initiative has yielded many positive results, and there has been an encouraging improvement in the number of girls enrolled in schools. Treating sons and daughters as equals, my government has also introduced a Bill to increase the minimum age of marriage for women from 18 years to 21 years at par with men”.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“The government has made a beginning to liberate the society from the manifestly arbitrary practice of Triple Talaq by making it a criminal offence. Restrictions on Muslim women from performing the Haj only with Mehram have also been removed. While about three crore students from minority communities were provided scholarships prior to 2014, my government has provided scholarships to 4.5 crore such students since 2014. This has led to a significant reduction in the school dropout rate of Muslim girls and an increase in their enrolment”, stated the President.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The President said “A provision has also been made for Gender Inclusion Fund in the National Education Policy to promote learning capability among our daughters. It is a matter of happiness that all the existing 33 Sainik Schools have started admitting girl students. The government has also approved the admission of women cadets in the National Defence Academy. The first batch of women cadets will enter the NDA in June 2022. With the policy decisions and encouragement of my government, the number of women personnel in various police forces has more than doubled as compared to 2014”.</p><p><br></p>",

Our efforts in protecting our Virasat is evident from the work the government has been putting in inscribing both our tangible and intangible heritage and also repatriating the cultural heritage that was stolen or taken away from India”, the Minister added.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><img src=\"https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/userfiles/image/image003W2O0.jpg\"></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\">&nbsp;<strong><em>Keshava Temple, Somanathapura</em></strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">All these three Hoysala temples are protected monuments of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and therefore conservation and maintenance will be done by ASI. The state government will ensure the conservation of state protected monuments which are around these three monuments since it would add to the visual integrity of the place. The District Master Plan of the state government will also incorporate the buffers of all monuments and build an integrated management plan. The state government will also look at the traffic management issues to be looked into especially around the designated property.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The sacred ensembles of the Hoysalas, built in the 12th-13th centuries and represented here by the three components of Belur, Halebid and Somnathapura, attest to the creativity and skill of the Hoysala artists and architects who built these masterpieces of a kind never seen before or since. The Hoysala architects used their profound knowledge of temple architecture in different parts of India to their advantage. The Hoysala temples have a basic Darvidian morphology but show strong influences of the Bhumija mode widely used in Central India, the Nagara traditions of northern and western India, and the Karntata Dravida modes favoured by the Kalyani Chalukyas. Therefore, the Hoysala architects made considered and informed eclectic selections of features from other temple typologies which they further modified and then complemented with their own particular innovations. The result was the birth of a completely novel 'Hoysala Temple' form.</p><p><br></p>",

However, former US President Donald Trump pulled Washington out of the pact in May 2018 and reimposed unilateral sanctions on Tehran, which prompted the latter to breach some of the deal's restrictions one year later, and advance its once-halted nuclear programs.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Since April 2021, eight rounds of talks have been held between Iran and other remaining parties in the Austrian capital of Vienna to revive the deal.</span></p>",

The Chief Minister said that her songs will be played in different places of the state for the next 15 days. The state government has also announced a half-day mourning in government offices on Monday. Lata Mangeshkar died at the Breach Candy hospital in Mumbai on Sunday morning. She was 92.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Chief Minister in her condolence message wrote: \"I am deeply saddened by the passing of legendary musician Lata Mangeshkar. She breathed her last in Mumbai today. She was 92 years old. There will be a huge void after her death\".</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Mentioning her as a rare musician and singer, the chief minister said, \"For the last eight decades she was in the heart of all the people of this country. She had made everybody captivated by her musical spell. She has sung countless songs including classical, ghazal, bhajan, modern and songs for numerous films. She has sung in 36 Indian and foreign languages including Hindi, Marathi, Bengali. She had deep relations with Bengal and Bengali songs. Many of our musical stars were enriched by her rare musical talent,\" she wrote.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">\"She has received numerous awards and honours including Bharat Ratna, Padma Bhushan, Padma Vibhushan, Dadasaheb Phalke Award, Legion of Honour, National Film Award, Bengal Film Journalists' Association Award,\" she said. \"Her death caused irreparable damage to the world of music.

The same site has now spotted the feature's beta testing, and it brings an old-school hamburger menu, as expected, reports Android Central.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">The three-dot menu that was previously located in the top right corner of the app has been removed in the new design. Instead, Messages has replaced that feature with a hamburger menu on the opposite side of the app.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">It contains the same essential options, such as \"Messages\", \"Starred\", \"Archived\", and \"Spam &amp; blocked\". In a separate section at the bottom of the menu, users will see the theme and device pairing options.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">In the current version of Messages, all of these options are located within the three-dot menu, making that section a bit crowded.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">If users prefer Google's old way of organising things, the switch to navigation drawer may be appealing, the report said.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">It is an interesting change seeing as Google recently got rid of this type of interface, most notably from the Play Store in favor of tabs, it added.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Alongside the retro navigation menu is the arrival of Google Photos integration with Messages, which first popped up in November of last year. This feature allows you to share videos in higher quality than MMS via the app.</span></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">New Delhi:</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">&nbsp;Samsung would like to position the upcoming Galaxy S22 series to not only be a super-flagship device to take the 'S' series legacy forward but also woo Galaxy Note users, industry experts said on Sunday.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Samsung is set to launch its next premium flagship S22 series on February 9.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">According to Counterpoint Research Director Tarun Pathak, Samsung S22 is coming at a very important time when the last two S series were impacted by the Covid pandemic in 2020 and supply chain challenges in 2021.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">\"It is coming at a time when the Galaxy Fold series is taking off very well and is transitioning from the Note series,\" Pathak told IANS.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Samsung last year said that it would not discard its Galaxy Note smartphone series. Such speculation mounted in January after Samsung launched the high-end model of the Galaxy S21 smartphone that supports the stylus.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Pathak said that Samsung would like to position Galaxy S22 series not only to bring in all the flagship features but also best of both worlds \"when it comes to attracting Note users and there are rumours that the high-end version of S22 might be aimed at that.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">\"Additionally, night photography and other camera advancements will be one of the key features to watch out for this time,\" he added.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">With ‘Galaxy Unpacked 2022' just days away, Samsung last week showed off the power of its advanced low-light smartphone photography capabilities with an eye-popping 3D billboard campaign in New York, London, Dubai, Kuala Lumpur and Seoul.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">\"The disruptive 3D tiger will burst through digital barriers to showcase how Samsung's next smartphone lineup is set to help users own the night with new advancements to its low-light smartphone photography technology,\" said the company.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Samsung has said that despite a poor demand for smartphones and tablets amid weak seasonality and uncertainties over component supply, it aims to secure solid profitability with a new Galaxy S series.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Looking ahead to the first quarter, the company is bullish on flagship sales of Galaxy S21 FE and Galaxy S22 series.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">According to multiple reports, the standard Galaxy S22 will have a 6.1-inch display. The Galaxy S22+, meanwhile, will have a 6.6-inch panel.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Instead of a primary 12MP camera yet again, the S22 and S22+ are both expected to have a 50MP Samsung GN5 sensor for the primary camera.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Meanwhile, it's rumoured that the same 10MP selfie camera will still be in use.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Under the hood, the Galaxy S22, S22+, and the S22 Ultra are expected to carry one of two processors.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Samsung's in-house Exynos 2200 chip could power the Galaxy S22 series in some regions. Samsung generally uses Snapdragon in the US, but Exynos in many international markets.</span></p>",

Yes! we're refreshing Chrome's brand icons for the first time in 8 years. The new icons will start to appear across your devices soon,\" Hu said in a tweet.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">The icon has been simplified/flattened by removing the shadows. The colours are brighter and the proportions are different, making the big blue ball in the middle noticeably bigger.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Google also is tweaking it further with different variations designed to look more at home on Windows, MacOS and iOS</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">\"We created OS-specific customizations. We want the icons to feel recognizably Chrome, but also well crafted for each OS. For example, on Windows, the icons take on an obviously gradated look, appearing at home on Windows 10 and 11,\" Hu added.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">The new Google Chrome logo will be live for users across all devices with the release of Chrome 100 soon.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">According to Hu one would start seeing the new icon now if you use Chrome Canary (the developer version of Chrome), but it will start rolling out for everyone else over the next few months.</span></p>",

More than her smile, that famous twinkle in her eye seemed to assure Lataji's countless fans that she was very much there.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">And how can she ever go away? Each of her more than 50,000 songs in 14 languages will ensure her immortality.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">As much as her voice is mesmerising, equally her carefully draped saree and tightly held hair with a small round 'bindi' in the middle of her forehead will remain etched in the memory of every Indian. She looked very much like a goddess in 'avatar'. It wasn't without a reason that generations has regarded Lataji as Goddess Saraswati incarnate.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Lata Didi, as the nation fondly calls her, has forever set the standards that perhaps may never be matched. Singing will never be like hers, although clones are in thousands.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Songs for every mood, every age, all seasons, festivals, celebrations, all occasions of happiness or sadness. From spiritually uplifting bhajans to soothing romantic numbers, to racy, pacy tracks, she did them all in her 73-year career as the voice of the nation.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Not a day or hour goes by when her songs are not being aired, sung by talent hunt participants, or remixed by sound engineers. remixed is not being aired or even hummed. Even for the upcoming generation, her songs are the lessons to be learnt and in musical talent shows aired on TV channels or FM radio, it is mostly her songs that are sung.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Lataji continues to live in her songs. She has been immortalised in her songs, and each time a song by her is sung, Lataji will come alive.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">All her songs are iconic; each is unique in its own style. There is no one that is the best, because all are the best. Her voice gave that magical touch to Hindi movies that have always been mostly about song and dance.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Lataji is every singer's dream, and for the masses her songs are emotions that they have grown with. Listening to her songs on the radio and TV, seeing them picturised in movies, singing them in school and college competitions, or in 'antaksharis', and dancing to them in wedding sangeet ceremonies, we have lived Lataji's songs for decades. They have been a part of the growing-up years of all Indians. Lata Mangeshkar has always been there, the quintessential diet of our emotions.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">\"Meri awaaz hi pehchaan hai ... chehra ye badal jayege ... meri awaaz hi pechaan hai ... ghar yaad rahe\" (My voice will be my identity even if the way I look changes). Gulzar sahab seemed to have written these words, which Lataji sang with Bhupinder Singh in 'Kinara' in 1977, inspired by her life.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Lata Didi, as the world will always remember her as, her voice and her face radiating magnanimity will never fade away.</span></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Antigua: </strong><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Shaik Rasheed, who was India's crisis man during the 2022 Under-19 World Cup, has said that his teammates are over the moon after winning the title and the victory was a tribute to the bonding among the players and the coaches.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">The batter showed solid temperament and played vital innings for the Indian team in all three knockout games in the World Cup.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">\"We have just won the Under-19 World Cup and we are over the moon. The victory was a tribute to the bonding among the players and the coaches who ensured we stayed here (in the Caribbean) like a family. My future... I will take it the way it comes. I need to improve my game and I will work on it,\" Rasheed told Cricbuzz.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Rasheed hit a 26 in a low-scoring but high-intensity chase in the quarter-final against Bangladesh and anchored the innings with a well-paced 94 in the semi-final against Australia and then set the match up with a solid 50 in the final against England. All three knocks came after the early loss of wickets.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Asked to explain those innings in the knockouts, the Andhra boy said he tried to play his natural game.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">\"Initially there was pressure but I tried to play my natural game. I am confident of my game and I played that way. Although there was not much practice before the knockouts (because of the Covid-induced isolation), we were confident. I had scored an unbeaten 72 in a practice game against Australia and that gave me a lot of confidence,\" he said.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Rasheed also recalled the tough time when he tested positive for Covid-19 during the tournament. He thanked the support staff for motivating the players during that tough phase.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">\"I never thought I had another chance in the tournament. I had given up hope of playing any more part in the tournament. Regular testing and 15-day quarantine and I thought the tournament has ended for me,\" the batter said while recalling the time when the Indian camp was hit by Covid-19 with half a dozen players, including himself, being forced into isolation.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">\"At that stage, the support staff backed us well, kept us motivated. We were in isolation and they would do regular video-calling and try to explain to us to treat this as a brief injury pause and not as a Covid disruption. Coaches and VVS Laxman Sir would be on the call and they would tell me there is a lot more to play in the tournament - quarterfinals, semi-finals, final, and all those games. They tried to instill a positive mindset,\" he added.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Since the four-wicket win in the final, the youngster has got lots of calls and messages. \"We have had a party. We celebrated the win, stayed together. The bonding is very good. And, yes I have not had time to answer all my calls and messages. I will respond to them all soon,\" he said.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Many of Rasheed's teammates have registered for the IPL auction but he would not be one to go under the hammer as he has not played a List A or a first-class game, which is a necessity to be eligible to feature in the IPL. However, he is not disappointed.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">\"Not exactly. I will get my opportunities. If I have not played this year it does not mean it is the end of the world. I will qualify eventually,\" he signed off.</span></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Bengaluru:</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">&nbsp;Pardeep Kumar's last-minute heroics helped Gujarat Giants beat Bengaluru Bulls 40-36 in a Pro Kabaddi League season 8 match, here on Sunday. The raider Pardeep scored a Super 10 (14 points) including four in the final minute to give Gujarat a very important win in their battle to secure a playoff spot. The Giants captain Sunil Kumar also had a good night in the right cover position with a High 5.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">On the other hand, Bengaluru Bulls will have only themselves to blame for the loss. A lapse of concentration in the final minutes cost them important points. Their raiders Pawan Sehrawat and Bharat scored Super 10s but di'n't get the necessary support from the defence.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">There was very little to separate the two sides in an evenly contested first half. Bengaluru started the match brightly with their captain Pawan Sehrawat looking in good form. But the raider was pinned to the mat in the early minutes by Parvesh Bhainswal with a Super Tackle which temporarily gave Gujarat the momentum.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">But Bengaluru immediately took back the lead with Bharat also joining in the raiding duties. They kept probing the experienced Gujarat defence.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Again, right when the Bulls smelled an all-out possibility, Sunil Kumar came up with a Super Tackle. Pardeep Kumar's 3-point Super Raid in the 15th minute gave Gujarat a slender advantage, but Pawan immediately clinched a 3-point Super Raid for the Bulls to douse the fire. The first half ended 15-14 with the Giants in the lead.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">The defenders continued to dominate in the early minutes of the second half. Gujarat's Sunil Kumar reached his High 5 with fellow cover defender Parvesh Bhainswal offering great support. Pardeep Kumar's 2-point raid in the 9th minute after the restart gave Gujarat a chance to inflict an all-out.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">They eventually got the game's first all-out with 9 minutes on the clock to build a 5-point lead. Bharat and Pawan Sehrawat kept working extra hard on the mat to keep the Bulls within touching distance. Bharat raced to a Super 10 and made it a 2-point game with 3 minutes remaining.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Pardeep's high-pressure raid fo'ced two Bulls' defenders into falling out of bounds. But Pawan Sehrawat immediately clinched a 2-point raid to once again reduce Gujarat's lead to 2 points.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">With a minute left to play Bulls got an all-out to level the scores at 35-35. But Pardeep Kumar produced two 2-point raids in the final minute of the match to take the game completely away from the Bulls.</span></p>",

It was also Sousa's fourth ATP title in his career.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Sousa lost his service in the eighth game in the first set after the first seven games went with serve before Ruusuvuori broke his service to take a 5-3 lead. However, Sousa came to return the favour in the next game and pulled things back. The Portuguese star held his serve to make it 5-5. The set went into the tiebreaker in which Sousa prevailed 11-9 to win the first set 7-6 in South Asia's only ATP 250 tournament.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Sousa continued in the same vein as he broke Ruusuvuori's serve in the second game of the second set and held his own serve to take a 3-0 lead. The Portuguese extended the lead to 4-2 before Ruusuvuori came storming back into the match. He broke Sousa's service and won five games in a row to win the second set 6-4.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">But Sousa found his range again as he dominated the third set, broke Ruusuvuori's service in the second and sixth games as he went on to win the set 6-1 and clinch the match in 2 hours and 43 minutes.</span></p>",

And in the government, it's the more. But this question I want to, in a way, suggest we should be absorbing the fact that we have cleared Air India, NINL (Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd) has found its buyer, LIC IPO is soon to happen. So, things are moving,\" she said.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">\"The market may be good and by logic of it, many people may say you should have sold it yesterday but it's probably not the way the government works because at the end of the day I am answerable in the parliament, answerable to the CAG, CVC (Central Vigilance Commission), not just the political executives. The permanent executives are very conscious. And lets not forget some cases have been revived by people seeking justice, whatever, even after 10-15 years of an issue being settled.\"</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Besides, Sitharaman added there is a sense of caution and she wants the industry and bureaucrats to appreciate that the bureaucrats should take sufficient time so that that nothing should be later found wanting.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">\"So, they (bureaucrats) do take their extra precautionary care and I would rather go on that route than push them over to speedily conclude. Yes I am interested in finishing the commitments given in last year's Budget which I didn't specify again in this year's, but we are moving ahead on the disinvestment.\"</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Lastly, she reiterated that the government will continue on the disinvestment front.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">The Centre, in its Budget document for FY23, has drastically lowered the divestment target to Rs 65,000 crore.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">According to the Budget document, the current fiscal FY22's divestment target was revised to Rs 78,000 crore from the Budget estimates of Rs 1.75 lakh crore.</span></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Chandigarh:</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">&nbsp;The Union Budget 2022 has rightly laid a significant amount of emphasis on the enhanced use of technologies. Digital Ecosystem for Skilling and Livelihood (DESH-Stack e-portal) is going to be launched aimed at empowering citizens with skill, reskill or upskill through on-line training, Haryana Governor Bandaru Dattatreya said on Sunday.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Startups will be promoted to facilitate 'Drone Shakti' and drone as a service. The use of drones in agriculture will open up new vistas of opportunities for tech startups, he said.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Taking the use of technology in the financial sector a step further, the newly proposed digital rupee will prove a very important milestone in faster, safer transactions, and cost effectiveness. It will be a big value addition to the ease-of-doing business, Dattatreya said in an article.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">In sync with the dynamics of new National Education Policy -- 2020, 'One class-One TV channel' programme of PM e-VIDYA will be expanded to 200 TV channels.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Virtual labs and skilling e-labs will be set up to apromote critical thinking skills and simulated learning environments'. The move to create high-quality e-content to be delivered through digital teachers will add a new dimension to classroom teaching.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">For the world-class quality universal education with personalised learning experience, a digital university will be established, said the Governor.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">The role of emerging technologies like blockchain, artificial intelligence, robotics, Internet of things and hyper automation is going to be critical for the services sector. These technologies will create new job opportunities in the services sector. Even the universities are increasingly using new technologies for providing the best learning experience to students.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">At the macro level, technologies are already playing a critical role in nation building. From e-Passport to one nation, one ration card (ONORC) -- a technology-driven distribution system that makes food security portable across the country -- the increasing use of technology is empowering the common man, paving the way for inclusive and good governance.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">\"During Covid-19, we saw the effective use of technologies by hospitals and doctors in attending to patients online. It is now becoming a preferential mode for doctors to attend to patients instead of calling them to OPDs. An open platform for National Digital Health Ecosystem, as is being envisioned by the Central government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji, will add much needed resilience in our health system,\" he said.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Similarly, 'National Tele Mental Health Programme' will make quality mental health counselling and care services a universal reality. Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network (CoWIN) is the backbone of India's vaccination drive.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">The use of technologies by the Haryana government is quite pervasive. The state is moving fast towards paperless governance by making e-governance central to the functioning of almost every department. Auto Appeal Software (AAS), Antyodaya Saral Portal, CM Window Portal, Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme, and Parivar Pehchan Patra (PPP) are some of the initiatives which show the state government's resolve to go digital in governance in a comprehensive manner, said the Governor.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">PPP is a unique initiative, aimed at bringing the entire family under one roof so that holistic benefits of government schemes reach them.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">In fact, digitization does not only enhance delivery of services and benefits of welfare schemes transparently but also helps us plugging loopholes faster and reaching out to those left out swiftly, added Dattatreya.</span></p>",

According to a report by Blockchain data platform Chainalysis, a small but growing portion of activity on NFT marketplaces could be attributed to money laundering.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">\"While money laundering in physical art is difficult to quantify, we can make more reliable estimates of NFT-based money laundering thanks to the inherent transparency of the Blockchain,\" the report said last week.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">According to legal and cyber law experts, the crypto ecosystem is becoming a fertile ground for cyber criminals.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">\"This is so as these crypto-assets and cryptocurrencies are all based on Blockchain and, therefore, are now being extensively used on the Dark Web for the purposes of perpetuating various cyber-criminal activities,\" Dr Pavan Duggal, a seasoned Supreme Court advocate and a cyber law expert, told IANS.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have become the de-facto currency on the Dark Web.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">The use of crypto assets and cryptocurrencies actually present a very difficult situation for the law enforcement agencies to track down the attribution of a particular cyber act from the Dark Net.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">\"This entire Blockchain-enabled tech is going to present a huge amount of challenges for nations, including India,\" said Duggal.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">While clearing some air on taxation regarding digital assets, the absence of a detailed Crypto Bill is making the overall situation even harder to assess especially on the illegal use of cryptocurrencies, feel experts.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">New Delhi-based cyberlaw expert Virag Gupta said that as Web 3.0 unfolds, crypto assets will gain tremendous traction.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">\"It will change the landscape of financial frauds and crimes since digital assets are safe haven for criminals. Digital assets can be misused by drug traffickers, militant organisations, hawala operators and money laundering players. It poses a serious threat to national security and huge challenges to the security agencies in India,\" Gupta told IANS.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">India is not prepared for the new wave of Blockchain-based cyber crimes.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">\"Not only is money laundering going to massively increase but more significantly, the cryptocurrencies are also going to be used for cyber terrorism and cyber radicalisation,\" said Duggal.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Cyber security expert Jiten Jain said that despite the government levying 30 per cent tax on digital assets including NFTs, the crypto/NFT market will boom and a lot of companies may attempt to scam innocent people who do not have much technical knowledge by showing them a mirage of hefty gains.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Another headache for the Indian law enforcement agencies is that the coverage of crypto-based tech crimes under the Indian cyberlaw is hardly existing.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">\"We have to realise that if we do not take effective appropriate steps fast, this crypto-based tech is going to be extensively used by terrorists for the purpose of targeting the sovereignty, security and integrity of India,\" warned Duggal.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">It is time that the legal frameworks need to be appropriately amended so as to enable the coverage of crypto or Blockchain-based technology and its misuse.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">According to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, democratic nations should work together on cryptocurrencies to ensure it does not end up in the wrong hands.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">\"Take cryptocurrency or Bitcoin for example. It is important that all democratic nations work together on this and ensure it does not end up in the wrong hands, which can spoil our youth,\" he said during a virtual keynote address at the Sydney Dialogue organised by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute last November.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Over Rs 4,000 crore of illegal transactions via cryptocurrency exchanges were unearthed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in India in the last one year, reports said in the same month last year.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Grave concerns were raised over the misuse of digital coins on the Dark Web for terror acts and drugs trafficking by militant organisations, and for money laundering and hawala-based transactions -- posing a serious threat to national security and a big challenge to the security agencies in the country.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">\"After the Union Budget 2022-23, top officials have cautioned the investors about the risks involved but ignored risks from underworld operations and the money-laundering syndicate,\" said Gupta.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">The time is ripe to come up with more holistic approach in this regard so that India can not just take the best benefits out of the crypto-based technology but also have appropriate enabling legal frameworks to effectively regulate the misuse of blockchain based tech for the purposes of committing cybercrimes and cyber security breaches, said experts.</span></p>",

Two weeks ago, when cops found that some money had been deposited into an account of some inmate's brother.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">\"We are getting an inquiry conducted and have transferred three staff from the jail,\" the DG Prisons said.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">The three jail staff include two Assistant Superintendents who have now been sent to the district lines of the jail headquarters.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Meanwhile, the seniormost prison official informed that as a precautionary measure, the lodgement of inmate Sukesh Chandrashekhar has also been changed to another jail. \"We have transferred him from Jail No 4 to 1,\" the official said.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Last month, the Economic Offence Wing (EOW) of Delhi Police had written to Tihar Jail authorities to take action against 82 jail officials who allegedly helped inmate Sukesh by providing him luxurious facilities inside the prison.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">In the letter, accessed by IANS, the EOW had mentioned the names of all the 82 jail officials.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">During the probe, the CCTV footage of ten cameras of Rohini Jail were collected and examined and it was found that the view of CCTV cameras installed in the barrack of accused Sukesh was completely blocked by curtains and mineral water bottles.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">The EOW had mentioned in the letter that no action was taken to remove the object from the view of the camera and for this jail officials got a hefty amount from Sukesh and his associates.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">\"Further, from statements of the arrested jail officials and documents, facts and evidence collected during investigation, it has come out that the money was paid to all the staff irrespective of their duties as bribe to ensure that they keep themselves away from spilling beans and remain silent. The officials of the Jail No 10, Rohini Jail, have also been found involved in taking undue favour from the accused persons, hence, a detailed enquiry/investigation is required to be conducted to reach at a logical conclusion,\" an excerpt from the letter read.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">It has been learnt that inmate Sukesh used to pay around Rs 1.50 crore every month for luxury facilities without any hindrance.</span></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">New Delhi: </strong><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Children, like adults, require some form of exercise in their daily routine to stay healthy. Your children are watching you and attempting to mimic everything you do, good or bad. As a result, it is critical to have an exercise routine in place in order to instill the habit of exercise in your children from the start. Encourage your children by telling them about the benefits of exercise or by finding fun ways to exercise.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">0 age should spend more time playing on the floor.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">1 - 3 should exercise for at least three hours per day. This entails playing aggressively.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">3 - 5 years old should exercise for at least three hours per day.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">5 -18 should engage in at least one hour of moderate to vigorous exercise per day, as well as a few hours of light exercise. This should include activities that strengthen the muscles and bones at least three times per week.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">18+ should engage in a mix of moderate and vigorous exercise to ensure adequate overall activity. They should also engage in muscle-strengthening activities at least twice a week.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Asha Vaghasia, Founder and Parenting Coach, We Positive Parenting, Ahmedabad commenting on fitness across young age says, \"As a parent, all you can do is create a fit environment. To encourage your child, you can set up a family routine. The activities you do as a family have a profound effect on children. Encourage them to do their chores by doing your chores yourself. Limit the use of T.V and smartphones and encourage the children to do the same. Start walking to the nearby shops instead of driving, and the kids will follow suit. Instead of watching television after dinner, encourage your child to set up and lead a few fun activities that they can do with friends and family. I have seen my parents wake up early and workout on a regular basis which inspired me in my childhood and it lead me to run marathons today and further ahead I have put my children into vigorous sports since a very young age and today exercising and being active is an essential part of their lifestyle.\"</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Asha shares ways which ensures that your family moves at least for 60 minutes each day. With activities ranging from informal, busy to planned sports:</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">1. Start early. Young children love to play and be active. Encouraging more safe and informal movement and play can help build a solid foundation for an active lifestyle.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">2. Set a good example by living an active life for yourself.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">3. Make exercise a part of your daily routine by taking family trips or playing sports together.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">4. Give your children ideas and things that encourage exercise.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">5. Exercising can be done with a lot of fun like dancing on a Bollywood dance number, playing blocks or simple activities like walking a pet or riding a bicycle to get milk.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">6. Take young people to places where they can work, such as community parks, community baseball stadiums, or basketball courts.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">7. Have a positive attitude about the physical activity when your child is involved and encourage them to take an interest in new activities.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">8. Make bodywork fun. Recreational activities can be anything your child enjoys, organized or unorganized. Activities 9. can range from group sports or individual activities to leisure activities such as walking, running, skiing, cycling, swimming, playing activities, or playing free time.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">10. Make sure they are safe! Always provide protections like helmets, wrist pads, or knee pads for activities such as cycling, or scooters, skateboarding, roller skating, rock-wall, and other activities where there is a high risk of injury. Also, make sure that the activities are appropriate for your child's age.</span></p>",

This brings the total round size to INR 210 Cr.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">The funding comes 11 months after the company received INR 45 Cr from Reckitt, a global FMCG behemoth in the health, hygiene, and nutrition sectors. The company is uniquely capitalised, with two global, strategic behemoths on their cap table-Colgate Palmolive and Reckitt Benckiser.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">\"We appreciate the company's emphasis on hair removal and personal care as a category.\" There is first mover advantage in this market, and the company has demonstrated strengths in developing innovative products. \"We are delighted to be working with Shantanu and his team,\" said Pankaj Gupta and Mohammed Alhassan, Co-Founders and Co-CEOs of Gulf Islamic Investments (GII).</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">In the next two years, the company plans to scale operations to INR 500 Cr top line with an omnichannel presence, and the funds will be used to expand its portfolio of personal care and hair removal products. GII will also be strategically positioned to provide access to GCC markets in addition to the company's existing domestic market expertise.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">BSC was founded in 2016 as a premium, direct-to-consumer (D2C) shaving regimen brand and has since expanded into various hair removal categories. BSC entered the women's hair removal market in 2020 with their brand 'Bombay Shaving Company-Women,' which now accounts for nearly 25 percent of the total business. It has a diverse product portfolio of over 100 SKUs, including hair removal products for both men and women. Shaving regimens, trimmers, beard products, razors for women, wax strips, hair removal creams, and other personal care products and accessories are all on the list. In the six years since its inception, BSC has served over 3 million customers through various channels. With its finger on the pulse of its customers, the brand is perceived as conscious, sensitive, and responsible.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">\"We are delighted to welcome GII to our cap table.\" We are solely committed to creating a brand that owns hair removal and personal care. \"As we grew from INR 150 Cr to 500 Cr and 1000 Cr, we needed an investor group to help us build an IPO-ready company,\" said Shantanu Deshpande, BSC's founder and CEO. \"Interactions with GII were always focused on the right things - the customer, the product experience, and the team quality,\" he continued.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">This is the company's sixth round of funding, with Reckitt, Colgate Palmolive, Sixth Sense Venture Partners, and industry heavyweights (including former TCS vice-chairman S Ramadorai and 16 senior partners from McKinsey &amp; Company) as investors.</span></p>",

The algorithm ends up picking the wrong signal and keeps promoting it further. To break this cycle, one should look for content that is engaging, but for a diverse audience, not for a like-minded one.\"</p><p>In collaboration with researchers at Indiana University and Dartmouth College, the team created a new algorithm using data on the web traffic and self-reported partisanship of 6,890 individuals who reflect the diversity of the United States in sex, race and political affiliation. The data was provided by online polling company YouGov. They also reviewed the reliability scores of 3,765 news sources based on the New Guard Reliability Index, which rates news sources on several journalistic criteria, such as editorial responsibility, accountability and financial transparency.</p><p>They found that incorporating the partisan diversity of a news audience can increase the reliability of recommended sources while still providing users with relevant recommendations. Since the algorithm isn't exclusively based on engagement or popularity, it is still able to promote reliable sources, regardless of their partisanship.</p><p>\"This is especially welcome news for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/social-media\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;\">social media</a>&nbsp;platforms, especially since they have been reluctant of introducing changes to their algorithms for fear of criticism about partisan bias,\" said co-author Filippo Menczer, distinguished Luddy professor of informatics and computer science at Indiana University.</p><p>Researchers said that platforms would easily be able to include audience diversity into their own recommendation algorithms because diversity measures can be derived from engagement data, and platforms already log this type of data whenever users click \"like\" or share something on a newsfeed.

    "description": "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">London (UK):</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> According to a new study led by Queen Mary University of London and Denver University, how well someone responds to a couple's therapy could be determined by their genes.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The study was published in the 'Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology'.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The well-established 'Prevention and Relationship Education Program' (PREP) has been shown to improve communication skills and the quality of relationships as well as prevent divorce among married couples. However, the effects of PREP can be inconsistent with some people benefiting more than others.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Previous studies have shown that individual differences in sensitivity can impact people's responses to positive and negative experiences including psychological therapies. Therefore, the researchers set out to explore whether differences in an individual's sensitivity could explain the varying responses observed with the program.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">As almost half of the differences in peoples' sensitivity can be explained by genetic factors the research team collected DNA from over 150 US couples taking part in PREP to explore if genes known to be associated with sensitivity impacted an individual's response to the program. They found that those individuals that were more genetically sensitive, benefitted more from this type of therapy.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Couples completed questionnaires to assess communication, bonding, marital satisfaction, and the likelihood of divorce both before and after treatment, and then at six-month intervals over a two-year follow-up period. The researchers found that an individual's genetic sensitivity had more impact in the years following treatment than in the short term. As PREP is a skills-based therapy, the researchers suggest that this result could reflect the time taken for individuals to adopt new skills.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The researchers assessed an individual's genetic sensitivity using two different measures, one based on looking at a small number of known genes related to sensitivity, and another that used genome-wide data with thousands of genetic variations. Whilst both approaches showed that people's responses to PREP depended on their genetic make-up, the results suggest that genetic sensitivity was best captured using the broad, genome-wide approach. Importantly, these findings were replicated in an independent sample included in the study.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Surprisingly, the researchers found that individuals with low genetic sensitivity who did not take part in the program showed similar positive responses in relation to marital satisfaction over time as individuals with higher sensitivity who were involved in the program. These findings suggest that whilst individuals with low sensitivity don't respond as well to treatment, in general they could be less vulnerable to typical relationship stressors experienced by couples.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Professor Michael Pluess, Professor of Developmental Psychology at Queen Mary University of London, said: \"Our findings show that an individual's genetic make-up can influence how they respond to couple's therapy. As we know that not everyone who takes part in relationship programs like PREP benefits in the same way, in future it could be helpful to identify people with low sensitivity, that might benefit less from these standard treatments, and potentially offer them an alternative.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">\"Whilst in this study we've used genetic data to determine an individual's sensitivity, this is not the only way to do this as an individual's sensitivity is also influenced by environmental factors. It may be more practical to use sensitivity questionnaires that can be quickly and easily completed to capture these differences.</span></p>",

What if the shopper prefers honey or bananas with their peanut butter? The recommendation&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/algorithm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">algorithm</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp;will offer less useful suggestions, costing the retailer a sale and potentially annoying the customer.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The research by Entezari, who recently received a doctoral degree in computer science at UC Riverside, Instacart collaborators, and her doctoral advisor Vagelis Papalexakis, brought a methodology called tensor decomposition -- used by scientists to find patterns in massive volumes of data -- into the world of commerce to recommend complementary products more carefully tailored to customer preferences.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Tensors can be pictured as multi-dimensional cubes and are used to model and analyze data with many different components, called multi-aspect data. Data closely related to other data can be connected in a cube arrangement and related to other cubes to uncover patterns in the data.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">\"Tensors can be used to represent customers' shopping behaviors,\" said Entezari. \"Each mode of a 3-mode tensor can capture one aspect of a transaction. Customers form one mode of the tensor and the second and third mode captures product-to-product interactions by considering products co-purchased in a single transaction.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">For example, three hypothetical shoppers -- A, B, and C -- make the following purchases:</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">A: Buys hot dogs, hot dog buns, Coke, and mustard in one transaction. B: Makes three separate transactions: Basket 1: Hot dogs and hot dog buns; Basket 2: Coke; Basket 3: Mustard C: Hot dogs, hot dog buns, and mustard in one transaction.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">To a conventional matrix-based&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/algorithm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">algorithm</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">, Customer A is identical to Customer B because they bought the same items. Using tensor decomposition, however, Customer A is more closely related to Customer C because their behavior was similar. Both had similar products co-purchased in a single transaction, even though their purchases differed slightly.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The typical recommendation&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/algorithm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">algorithm</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp;made predictions based on the item the customer just purchased while tensor decomposition could make&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/recommendations\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">recommendations</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp;based on what is already in the user's whole basket. Thus, if a shopper has dog food and peanut butter in their basket but no bread, a tensor-based recommendation&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/algorithm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">algorithm</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp;might suggest a fillable dog chew toy instead of jelly if other users have also made that purchase.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">\"Tensors are multidimensional structures that allow modeling of complex, heterogeneous data,\" said Papalexakis, an associate professor of computer science and engineering. \"Instead of simply noticing which products are purchased together, there's a third dimension. These products are purchased by this kind of user and the&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/algorithm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">algorithm</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp;tries to determine which kinds of users are creating this match.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">To test their method, Entezari, Papalexakis, and co-authors Haixun Wang, Sharath Rao, and Shishir Kumar Prasad, all researchers for Instacart, used an Instacart public dataset to train their&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/algorithm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">algorithm</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">. They found that their method outperformed state-of-the-art methods for predicting customer-specific complementary product&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/recommendations\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">recommendations</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">. Though more work is needed, the authors conclude that big data tensor decomposition could eventually find a home in big business as well.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">\"Tensor methods, even though very powerful tools, are still more popular in academic research as far as recommendation systems go,\" said Papalexakis. \"For industry to adopt them we must demonstrate it's worthwhile and relatively painless to substitute for whatever they have that works already.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">While previous research has shown the benefits of tensor modeling in recommendation problems, the new publication is the first to do so in the setting of complementary item recommendation, bringing&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/tensor-methods\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">tensor methods</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp;closer to industrial adoption and technology transfer in the context of recommendation systems.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">\"Tensor methods have been adopted successfully by industry before, with chemometrics and food quality being great examples, and every attempt like our work demonstrates the versatility of&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/tensor-methods\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">tensor methods</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp;in being able to tackle such a broad range of challenging problems in different domains,\" said Papalexakis.</span></p>",

Sociology so far used two concepts to describe this preference for social stability, namely, (Social) Balance Theory and the theory of homophily (\"birds of a feather flock together\"). Now, researchers from the Complexity Science Hub Vienna (CSH) have proposed a simpler approach.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Their study has been published in the 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)'.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">They were able to boil the emergence of stable societies down to one of the two concepts alone: homophily, or our preference to interact with people similar to ourselves. The researchers showed that social balance then followed automatically and demonstrated this fact with data from the Massive Multiplayer Online Game Pardus.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">\"To explain how innovative this paper is, we have to elaborate on Social Balance Theory first,\" said CSH President Stefan Thurner, one of the authors of the paper. Social Balance Theory (SBT), introduced by the Austrian sociologist Fritz Heider in 1946, originally described the interpersonal relations between three individuals.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">According to SBT, three people connecting to each other formed triangles which can be called balanced or unbalanced, depending on the likes and dislikes between the three individuals. An example for a balanced triangle is, when Anna likes Bert, Bert likes Corinna, and Corinna likes Anna. If all of them dislike each other, the triad would be unbalanced. (For other variants, see figure).</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The Social Balance Theory claims that unbalanced&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/relationships\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">relationships</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp;cause bad feelings, why people tend to avoid them. \"Which is exactly what we can observe - and count - in real-world societies,\" elaborated complexity scientist Tuan Minh Pham, the first author of the study. \"Balanced triangles appear way more often than we would expect if they were statistically even distributed. Conversely, unbalanced triangles are underrepresented in societies.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">According to this theory, people considered triadic information before they formed (or changed) their social relations: If Anna liked Bert, but Bert did not like Corinna, Anna might decide to dump Corinna just to keep the balance. \"Yet we think it is way too complicated for people to think in triangles all the time,\" said Pham.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Instead, the scientists tried what happened when they applied the concept of homophily alone. \"For our theory, we assume that individuals tend to minimize their social stress; to do so, they prefer to interact with people they like. They might choose somebody to become a friend because he or she has the same opinion, or religion, or education, for instance,\" said Pham. Based on homophilic one-to-one interactions, the computer simulation produced a society that almost magically self-organized towards more stability. \"The society looked exactly like a society that follows Social Balance Theory, but without individuals having to consider triangles,\" Tuan Minh Pham pointed out.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">To test this hypothesis, the scientists used data from the free Massive Multiplayer Online Game Pardus. In the futuristic Pardus world, some 100,000 players interact economically and socially in space, form friendships, co-operate or compete, make friends and fight enemies. Since the game went online in 2004, the scientists log every single interaction between the gamers; by subscribing, the users give their consent that the data can be used for scientific purposes.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">\"We showed in several studies already that the players behave online just like they would behave in real life,\" said Thurner. \"That makes Pardus such a great data source to study group formation and social dynamics.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">In a further step, the scientists have planned to test their findings with data from a large&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/online-social-experiment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">online social experiment</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp;pursued together with CSH External Faculty member Mirta Galesic from the Santa Fe Institute.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">\"In physics, we love simple formulas - we call them beautiful,\" said Thurner. \"With this paper we explain seemingly complicated human interactions in a very simple way. Homophily as the driving force for social balance and stability - I would say, this is a really beautiful new understanding in&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/sociology\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">sociology</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">.\"</span></p>",

Each patient underwent 4 cycles of chemo before their surgery.</p><p>To assess the impact of the exercise programme during chemo, blood samples were taken before starting treatment, within a week of finishing, and then again, 1, 3, and 6 days after surgery to check on levels of inflammation and other key biochemical indicators of immunity.</p><p>Each patient was also scanned to assess changes in skeletal muscle mass and visceral fat and tumour size before and after chemo.</p><p>In all, 21 patients were assigned to prehab and 19 to conventional best practice with no additional structured exercise.</p><p>Analysis of all the clinical data showed that after pre-surgical chemo the prehab group had higher rates of tumour shrinkage than patients treated conventionally: 15/20 (75 per cent) compared with 7/19 (37 per cent).</p><p>And based on tissue samples and the number of affected lymph nodes, more patients in the prehab group had their cancer downstaged: 9 (43 per cent) vs 3 (16 per cent).</p><p>These patients also had greater skeletal muscle mass and less visceral fat, but without any weight loss, as well as a stronger immune response and lower levels of inflammatory chemicals in their blood.</p><p>A relatively small number of patients were included in this clinical trial and they weren't randomly allocated to try and eliminate the influence of unknown factors, so further larger studies are needed to confirm the findings, cautioned the researchers.</p><p>But they pointed out, \"Tumour downstaging and response to chemotherapy are arguably the most important prognostic factors in oesophageal cancer.</p><p>\"That structured exercise programmes might contribute to improved cancer regression, possibly through enhanced immunological and/or inflammatory modulation, is potentially clinically significant,\" they said.</p><p>They added, \"The results from this analysis, showing improvements in pathological regression in the primary tumour and clinical downstaging are hypothesis-generating and the first to be demonstrated in a clinical trial in oesophageal cancer.\"</p><p>And they concluded, \"While the limitations in patient numbers and non-randomised design mandate caution, the impact for patients is potentially significant. Further work to confirm or refute these findings is urgently required, including whether or not improvements in chemotherapy response may translate into a survival advantage.\"</p><p>\"Pending this, the present results further strengthen the rationale for exercise to be prescribed as standard care in patients undergoing treatment for cancer,\" they added.</p>",

The results show that the risk is greater when these sorts of conditions develop at a younger age (mid-50s) rather than later in life.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Evidence showed that multimorbidity was common, particularly at older ages and in people living with dementia. But studies examining whether multimorbidity at earlier ages affects the risk of subsequent dementia were lacking.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">To fill this knowledge gap, researchers set out to examine the long-term association between multimorbidity at ages 55, 60, 65, and 70 and subsequent dementia.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Their findings are based on data collected from over 10,000 British men and women taking part in the Whitehall II Study, which is looking at the association of social, behavioural, and biological factors on long term health. When participants joined the study in 1985-88, they were aged 35 to 55 and were free of dementia.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">For this study, multimorbidity was defined as the presence of at least two&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/chronic-conditions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">chronic conditions</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp;out of a predefined list of 13 chronic diseases, excluding dementia. Subsequent cases of dementia were identified using hospital and death records up to 31 March 2019.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Of the 10,095 participants, 6.6 per cent had multimorbidity at age 55 and 32 per cent at age 70. Over a median follow-up period of 32 years, 639 cases of dementia were identified.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">After taking account of a range of factors including age, sex, ethnicity, education, diet and lifestyle behaviours, multimorbidity at age 55 was associated with a 2.4-fold higher risk of dementia (1.56 per 1,000 person years) compared with people without any of the 13&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/chronic-conditions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">chronic conditions</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">. This association weakened progressively with older age at onset of multimorbidity.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">For example, at age 65, onset of multimorbidity before age 55 was associated with a 2.5-fold higher risk of dementia (3.86 per 1,000 person years) compared with a 1.5-fold higher risk (1.85 per 1,000 person years) in those with onset of multimorbidity between age 60 and 65.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">In other words, for every 5-year younger age at onset of multimorbidity up to age 70, the risk of dementia was 18 per cent higher.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">When the researchers examined more severe multimorbidity (defined as three or more&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/chronic-conditions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">chronic conditions</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">), the importance of younger age of onset of multimorbidity for the risk of dementia was further accentuated.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">For example, compared with people with no or one chronic condition, those with three or more&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/chronic-conditions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">chronic conditions</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp;at age 55 had a nearly fivefold higher risk of dementia, whereas the risk was 1.7-fold higher when onset of multimorbidity was at age 70.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">This is an observational study, so can't establish cause, and the researchers point to some limitations, such as possible misclassification of some dementia cases, and the fact that study participants are likely to be healthier than the general population.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">However, this was a large study with over 30 years of follow-up, and results were similar after further analyses using death as the outcome measure, which the researchers say increases confidence in their findings on dementia.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">\"Given the lack of effective treatment for dementia and its personal and societal implications, finding targets for prevention of dementia is imperative,\" they write. \"These findings highlight the role of prevention and management of chronic diseases over the course of adulthood to mitigate adverse outcomes in old age.</span></p>",

The most walkable areas of New York City include Battery Park City, Greenwich Village, NoHo, SoHo, Little Italy, and the West Village (Manhattan CBs 1 and 2). The least walkable areas include neighbourhoods in eastern Queens and parts of Staten Island (Queens CB13 and Staten Island CB2).</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">\"Given the long-lasting benefits of healthy pregnancies for parental and child health, this research provides further impetus for the use of urban design and poverty reduction to support healthy weight and reduce the risk of excessive gestational weight gain and related health risks,\" said the study's first author, Eliza Kinsey, PhD, formerly a postdoctoral research scientist in the Department of Epidemiology, now an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The current study was conducted in partnership with researchers at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) Bureau of Vital Statistics and used de-identified birth record data for the year 2015 to examine neighbourhood-level influences on GWG. Using medical record data, the DOHMH compiled data on all live births in the city, including basic health and demographic information for the pregnant individual and birth outcome statistics (e.g., birth weight, gestational age).</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Among the sample of 106,285 births, 42 per cent of the pregnant individuals experienced excessive GWG, and 26 per cent had inadequate GWG.

They looked at data from more than 1.9 million Medicare beneficiaries who had been diagnosed with&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/covid-19\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">COVID-19</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp;between November 2020 and August 2021, and compared rates of receiving&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/mabs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">mAbs</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp;by age, sex, race and ethnicity, region, and number of chronic conditions.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">They found that, among Medicare beneficiaries who weren't hospitalized or who didn't pass away within seven days of their diagnosis, only 7.2 per cent received mAb therapy. The likelihood of receiving&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/mabs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">mAbs</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp;was higher among those with fewer chronic conditions -- 23.2 per cent of those with no chronic conditions received&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/mabs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">mAbs</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">, versus 6.3 per cent, 6.0 per cent, and 4.7 per cent of those with 1-3, 4-5, and 6 or more chronic conditions, respectively. The researchers also found that Blacks were less likely to receive&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/mabs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">mAbs</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp;than whites -- 6.2 per cent versus 7.4 per cent.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">In addition, there were significant differences among states when it came to mAb treatment. For example, Rhode Island and Louisiana administered&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/mabs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">mAbs</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp;to the highest proportion of non-hospitalized patients with&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/covid-19\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">COVID-19</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp;(24.9 per cent and 21.2 per cent), while Alaska and Washington administered the lowest proportion (1.1 per cent and 0.7 per cent). Southern states had the highest rates of mAb therapy (10.6 per cent of beneficiaries), while states in the West had the lowest rates (2.9 per cent).</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Speculating as to why mAb therapy often failed to reach the highest-risk&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/covid-19\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">COVID-19</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp;patients, the researchers said it's possible that higher-risk patients may have had difficulty navigating the multiple steps needed to receive&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/mabs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">mAbs</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">, from receiving a timely diagnosis to referral and scheduling an infusion within 10 days. As for differences among states, they suggested that mAb supply may have been low or less used by clinicians in some regions of the US.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">\"We need new approaches to prevent these inequities from happening again with newer treatments on the horizon,\" said Barnett.</span></p>",

Washington University serves as a clinical site that evaluates patients, and a model organism screening site that develops models to study genes in zebrafish and roundworms.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Interstitial lung disease is a broad term for a disease in which the lungs gradually deteriorate, causing scarring that makes it increasingly difficult to breathe. Several gene abnormalities have been associated with interstitial lung disease in infants and children, but some patients have the disease despite harbouring none of the known genetic abnormalities. In the new study, the&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/research\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">research</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">ers were presented with the case of a&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/young-child\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">young child</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp;with interstitial lung disease of unknown cause. The child later died of the disease.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/research\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">research</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">ers analyzed the child's DNA code as well as the DNA code of both parents. A team of bioinformatics specialists at Baylor College of Medicine then narrowed down the initial long list of DNA code changes or genetic variants they identified -- many of which are harmless -- to a smaller list of possible culprits. The lung tissue from the child had evidence of a problem with surfactant in the lungs. In the lungs' air sacs, surfactant is a complex mixture of proteins and lipids that reduces surface tension in the air sacs and keeps them open, easing the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide during breathing. Many people with interstitial lung disease have abnormalities in the surfactant protein genes. But this child did not have any genetic variants in the code of the surfactant protein genes.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Rather, the&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/research\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">research</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">ers found a variant in a gene that made a protein called RAB5B that turned out to be part of the cellular machinery that processes the surfactant proteins, the&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/research\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">research</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">ers later learned. They showed that the RAB5B protein plays a vital role in packaging the surfactants into tiny compartments called vesicles and moving them to their proper locations. In this case, the genetic variant did not simply prevent the protein from working -- the genetic variant caused the protein to be actively harmful.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">\"When mutations happen that break a protein, usually the protein just doesn't work anymore -- its function is missing,\" said co-senior author Tim Schedl, PhD, a professor of genetics. \"But this is a case where the broken protein is not only not working, it's actively poisoning other processes. This results in the loss of the surfactants in the lungs.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/research\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">research</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">ers were able to identify this abnormality by studying the genetic variant in roundworms that are called C. elegans. The child had only one abnormal copy of the gene, demonstrating that even having one normal copy did not compensate for the poisonous protein produced by the mutated copy.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Worms with one abnormal copy required three normal copies to restore normal function, demonstrating the poisonous activity of the abnormal copy, according to experiments conducted by first author Huiyan \"Winnie\" Huang, PhD, an instructor in paediatrics. And consistent with these genetics, the&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/research\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">research</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">ers found that neither of the child's parents had the genetic abnormality, indicating that the variant was only present, by happenstance, in the child's genes and was therefore a new variant in the DNA that arose during embryonic development.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">\"In so many cases, we don't know why a patient has a particular disease,\" said co-senior author Steven L. Brody, MD, the Dorothy R. and Hubert C. Moog Professor of Pulmonary Medicine. \"But we were able to solve this case, and there's a real satisfaction in that. Potentially, this could lead to finding answers for other people who have diseases similar to this.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Added co-author Jennifer A. Wambach, MD, an associate professor of pediatrics: \"This gene, RAB5B, is now associated with interstitial lung disease in children. There are patients with a clinical diagnosis of interstitial lung disease without a genetic explanation. For these patients, sequencing RAB5B may reveal changes in their DNA code that could account for their disease. Knowing the underlying genetic cause and identifying other patients with the same genetic problem can help us better predict the course of the disease, so we can better prepare patients and their families for what is to come, such as whether the patient may respond to treatments, or worsen to needing a lung transplant, or whether it may be appropriate to begin discussing compassionate care.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">While the diagnosis was not able to help the patient in this case, knowledge of the underlying cause allowed the parents to know that the genetic variant was not inherited and there would be a very low chance of future children having the same disease.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">\"Because these types of genetic diseases are so rare, there's very little information out there for patients or families,\" said co-senior author Stephen C. Pak, PhD, an associate professor of paediatrics. \"But collectively, there are millions of people who live with rare genetic diseases. That's why the Undiagnosed Diseases Network was formed -- to bring together bioinformatics specialists,&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/topic/research\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">research</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">ers, lung biologists, paediatricians and other experts into this type of unique collaboration to try and address this unmet need.</span></p>",

Another defeat will put the team on the brink of elimination.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(56, 54, 54);\">Islamabad skipper Shadab Khan, who won the toss and opted to bat first, continued his brilliant all-round form and raised his wickets tally to 14. Shadab picked up 4-15 through his sharp legspin bowling that restricted Karachi to 135-9 in its unimpressive chase.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(56, 54, 54);\">Earlier, Islamabad's seasoned Twenty20 top order made 177-6 on a slow and dry wicket with Paul Stirling hitting 39 upfront in his last PSL game this season and Shadab scoring 34 off 19 balls.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(56, 54, 54);\">Stirling will be going back to Ireland for national duty. The opener scored 187 runs in five PSL games that pushed Islamabad to No. 2 in the standings, four points behind Multan Sultans.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(56, 54, 54);\">Babar said his team needed more confidence.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(56, 54, 54);\">Unfortunately, we have lost all games so far, (but) I will try to give the boys more confidence going ahead, said Babar, who took three splendid catches in an otherwise below-par performance by his teammates.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(56, 54, 54);\">I think we leaked some extra runs, but I still felt that it was a chaseable total.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(56, 54, 54);\">Injury-hit Karachi has struggled to challenge oppositions at home as their key fast bowler Mohammad Amir was ruled out from the tournament without playing a game.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(56, 54, 54);\">English bowler Chris Jordan (2-36) picked up two late wickets in his first game both catches by Babar to dismiss Shadab and Colin Munro (33) before Azam Khan played a cameo of 16 off just 7 balls to lift Islamabad's total.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(56, 54, 54);\">Karachi always seemed to struggle once it lost Babar (8) and Sharjeel Khan (6) inside the batting powerplay. Sharjeel was run out in a mix-up with his skipper while fast bowler Mohammad Wasim knocked back the off stump of Babar in the fifth over.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(56, 54, 54);\">Shadab then ran through the middle-order with his sharp googlies and legspinners before Mohammad Nabi resisted with an unbeaten 47 off 28 balls.</span></p>",

Winner of the International Woolmark Prize for menswear 2016, Dhir has created a brand backed by an incredible story. \"My brand is a reflection of myself. It comes from where I come from, the roots of India. Ive grown up listening to tales of different crafts and cultures from my grandmother, and theyre a big part of who I am,\" adds Dhir. We spoke to the designer about his minimal aesthetic, sustainability, and future plans. Read on.</p><p>Dhir is known for revamping Indian textiles. His clothes speak volumes about his refined aesthetic. He launched his label in 2011 and, for the first eight years, only did menswear. \"Initially, it was a lot of cotton, linen, and silk, followed by ikat, brocade, and other materials. I like to design and make things that I can wear. If I can't wear it, I won't make it.\" What inspires him? He says, \"My own life, and everything around me. I have a set of close friends who are non-fashion. There's so much to gather from their lives and experiences. \"I'm a curious person who enjoys observing and learning from the people around me and the places I visit.\"</p><p>It was at Good Earth that Dhir showcased his first collection. The Delhi-based retail space that houses some of the most exquisite apparel and décor was founded by Anita Lal more than two decades ago. \"She is my mentor, and she encouraged me to do more and better. She was the first person who I showed my collection to, and it was love at first sight. When we met for the first time, we felt like we came from the same place. Our aesthetic might be slightly different, but there's so much synergy-there's a very natural sync.\" He continues to add, \"She is someone who you can learn a lot from. She is humble and honest, and she's been there throughout my career. \"</p><p>\"I'd like to think of myself as the 'OG' sustainable brand, but I insisted on removing the term from all my communications a few years back. It was getting too dogmatic.\" For Dhir, sustainability has an alternate meaning. He believes in \"buy less, buy good,\" a life lesson his grandmother passed onto him. In the past few years, the Indian fashion industry has been slowly inching towards sustainability and conscious consumerism. Planet positivity, recycling, and upcycling are terms that are gaining relevance. \"For me, buying 'good' means something that is fashionable, classic, relevant, high-quality, low-maintenance, versatile, and is a collectible. Sustainable fashion is far more holistic for me than just buying organic. It has to be a responsible fashion move. For example, all our fabrics are biodegradable and high-quality and can be passed down through generations, making them reusable,\" says the designer.</p><p>Dhir's design philosophy is dominated by textiles that are converted into luxurious, unique pieces. Whether it's his minutely detailed menswear, his brocade pantsuits for women, or his whimsical prints, he's here to inject our everyday fashion with all things unique. On being asked about the one thing he would like to change in the current Indian fashion scene, he says, \"I would undo the 'Bollywoodisation' of Indian weddings. They have become so homogenous that everything looks the same. The cultural shift is missing. It's just the same lehenga choli everywhere. The beauty of our country lies in its different cultures, and it would be nice to see some diversity. \"</p><p>The toughest time for me was after winning the Woolmark. Too much happened too soon. I was ready as a designer, but not as a company. However, today I'm more settled and ready to expand and diversify,\" says Dhir. He adds, \"I want to jump into décor, crockery, swimwear; the list is endless. But I only want to collaborate with experts as that's the best way to do it.\"</p><p>His brand is not only popular in big cities but in smaller towns as well. He recently showcased his collection at Amiraah, a multi-designer store in Kanpur, and feels that there's no difference between the two. I think it's the same consumer now. \"Social media has bridged all kinds of gaps that existed, making everyone stay connected and updated,\" says Dhir.</p>",

    "postText": "Kitchen hacks: Ways to use a Zipper Bag\n",
    "subHeading": "",
    "description": "<p><strong>New Delhi: </strong>&nbsp;The global pandemic has undoubtedly taught us the importance of time management and the use of multi-utility products to organise our lives. High quality zipper bags are a recent innovation for a hassle-free and organised experience. These bags have caused a significant revolution in kitchens and are also suitable for other items that need to be kept organised and in one location.</p><p>These zipper bags are a godsend for work-from-home couples and nuclear families in India who need to make their food preparations last longer and eat healthier, especially since they must balance meal prep with work or other household responsibilities. Asahi Kasei, Japan's No. 1 Premium Wrap and silicone-coated foil &amp; sheet brand, has launched a unique seal-tight double line zipper bag that gives it a competitive advantage over other zipper bags on the market.</p><p>Here are six unique ideas to use Zipper Bag for a healthy and hassle free lifestyle:</p><p>Store one week's meal: Use an Asahi Kasei Zipper Bag to make one week's worth of meal prep and organise it by labelling the bags with the designated day/type of meal stored in them. This can make your week's meals less stressful and save you time on last-minute preparations. In fact, if any of your meals contain curry, the leak proof double seal technology prevents it from spilling. Furthermore, the label space makes it easy to organise.</p><p>Keep leafy vegetables fresh for longer time: Leafy vegetables, such as coriander leaves, mint leaves, methi leaves, spinach, or spring onions, generally spoil even when refrigerated. To keep them fresh for a longer period of time, first dry them out (if there is any water) by leaving them open in the room on a piece of paper. Once the water has dried up, place it in a Zipper Bag and place it in the refrigerator. The innovative Zipper Bag traps moisture and thus keeps your leafy greens fresh and in good condition for a long time.</p><p>Smoothie Meal Prep: Health-conscious individuals who enjoy smoothies and include them in either of their meals on a daily basis can now relax about taking time away from their chores to prepare them. These zipper bags keep your chopped fruits fresh for an extended period of time. The fruit combinations, as well as the day and meal time, can be listed on the label, and you're done. The recyclable Zipper Bag allows you to maintain a healthy lifestyle without having to chop fresh fruits every day.</p><p>Store Marinated Meat: Even when frozen, it is difficult for non-vegetarians to keep meat fresh for an extended period of time. But they no longer have to be concerned because, unlike a regular zipper bag, the Asahi Kasei Zipper Bag not only keeps your meat fresh but also keeps your kitchen smelling fresh by locking in the odour. So use these zipper bags for fresh, odor-free storage.</p><p>Streamline the freezer: You can save freezer space by freezing food flat in zipper bags for easy stacking instead of using a hard plastic container. Because these double-line zipper bags are leak-proof, you can use them for soups as well; just don't put anything heavy on top before it sets.</p><p>DIY pastry bag: When you're ready to bake and realise you're out of pastry bags, turn to the Zipper Bag for assistance. You only need a ZipperBag and a pair of scissors, and you'll be done in no time. To fill cupcake moulds, cut half the bag off, place the filling inside, roll it from above, cut a slightly thicker part off the corner, and easily fill the moulds. To pipe a long-winded birthday message, simply snip off the tip of the corner.</p><p>While the Zipper Bag appears to be a simple household item, it can be used for a variety of purposes. Savouries, dry fruits, curries, purees, and even marinated meat can be stored and labelled, and it also makes snacking on the go easier and less clumsy. You can refrigerate leftover food in the bags, store dry spice powders, organise jewellery, carry travel essentials, and even organise medicines.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>New Delhi:</strong>&nbsp;Nutraceuticals, functional foods, and supplemental micronutrients have the potential to inhibit cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. A variety of natural dietary herbs have even been shown to have a potential role in the prevention and treatment of cancer, and are regarded as an effective strategy by Nutraceutical experts all over the world.</p><p>Epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated that dietary habits are one of the most important predictors of chronic diseases, including several types of cancer. Thus, diet and food have a direct impact on health and disease. Through nutrition, humans have evolved a sophisticated and cooperative system of antioxidant defence mechanisms against toxic oxygen intermediates, according to biochemical and epidemiological evidence. This suggests that increasing antioxidant intake through nutrition may significantly reduce the risk of cancer.</p><p>Following are some of the herbs suggested by the experts in nutraceutical space which has significantly shown positive results in the prevention of cancer cells-</p><p>Graviola (Annona muricata):</p><p>Annona Muricata, also known as Graviola, soursop, Brazilian pawpaw, or guanabana, is an evergreen tree native to the Americas' tropical regions and a member of the Annonaceae family. Graviola contains hundreds of acetogenins, which are chemicals (ACGs). ACGs have the ability to kill many different types of cancer cells while leaving healthy cells alone. It aids in the inhibition of energy production in cancer cells while also inhibiting the oxidative stress response. Graviola has also been shown to cause apoptosis. In addition to its positive effects, the herb may cause some side effects such as low blood pressure, low sugar levels, or even nerve damage. As a result, it is strongly advised not to consume directly. To avoid any access consumption or such side effects, please use a product supplement that contains the desired amount of Graviola.</p><p>Catharanthus Rosea</p><p>Catharanthus Rosea, also known as Madagascar Periwinkle, is a miracle plant. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family. It is the most medicinally valuable plant species in the Apocynaceae family, which is used worldwide in traditional herbal medicine. The plant has also been used in Ayurvedic medicine and traditional Chinese medicine for a long time. Western medical science began researching this plant in the twentieth century. Catharanthus roseus is well-known for producing the anticancer drugs vinblastine and vincristine, which are derived from the dimerization of the MIAs vindoline and catharanthine. The anti-tumor activity discovered in C. Roseus is due to the presence of dimeric alkaloids, which are already widely used in industry.</p><p>Podophyllum</p><p>Indian Podophyllum is another name for Podophyllum. Vanyakarkati is its Ayurvedic name. The rootstock of this herb has beneficial properties that aid in the prevention of cancer. Podophyllum is a purgative that is also used to treat vaginal warts. Etoposide and teniposide, two podophyllotoxin derivatives, are used in cancer treatment. Etoposide is an alkaloid derived from the mandrake plant Podophyllum peltatum that is used to treat germ cell tumours, lung cancer, Hodgkin's and non-lymphomas, Hodgkin's gastric cancer, breast cancer, and testicular cancer. Although podophyllotoxin has a high cytotoxic effect and acts as a tubulin polymerization inhibitor, if used excessively, it is more toxic than beneficial as an anticancer drug. As a result, it should only be consumed in the amounts recommended by an expert in the form of supplements, with the quantities added rationally.  </p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>New Delhi:</strong>&nbsp;When it comes to sharing our thoughts, addressing an audience, or simply speaking to someone, communication and diction are crucial. And as for international competitions or representations, it takes a team of experts to train young delegates representing a country on a global scale. One such driving force behind Miss India Organisation's beauty queens performing to the best of their abilities on the international stage is Supreet Bedi, Communication and Diction Expert.</p><p>About training Harnaaz and helping her wade through her self-doubt and wavering confidence, Supreet says, \"Harnaaz always had determination. She believed she was winner material but was practical enough to know that she needed polishing. Her accent and pronunciation had to be toned down. Removing mother tongue influence is hard work and took dedicated sessions to get her to rise above her regional influences and sound more international without being fake. Our environment makes us; so I encouraged her to create a suitable environment by watching English content, following the right channels and covering role plays and mock interactions. Above and beyond the basics of communication, we often had philosophical chats that helped deepen her emotional quotient while cross-referencing her personal experiences. It took a dedicated team of panellists to get her there! Over time, her answers showcased depth, compassion, empathy and substance. I was all teary when watching the finale live and jumped with joy when her name was announced! She did prove to be that ideal student!\"</p><p>Having had a pageant experience herself, Supreet was intrigued by the background stories and their translation on-screen. Soon after, she joined the esteemed panel at Miss India Organisation as their Communication Expert and since has been training India's pageant winners for international representation.</p><p>\"It's hard work preparing the delegates for that prim and proper delivery but all that effort is worth the victorious return!\", she states. \"I remember doing vigorous sessions with Rohit Khandelwal before his departure for Mr. World 2016. He became the first Indian to bag the title of Mr. World!\" Her belief is that confidence is self-made. \"No one is born confident,\" she adds.</p><p>\"It's truly the fruit of your labour! If you don't shirk practice, I can guarantee a transformation that will stand you proud.\"</p><p>(N. Lothungbeni Humtsoe can be contacted at lothungbeni.h@ians.in)</p>",

The closely-fought encounter saw both teams take the lead multiple times before settling for a tie in the final minute.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Bengal captain Maninder Singh scored a Super 10 (11 points) but that wasn't once again enough to save his team. The defending champions will now need a flawless end to the season and a few other results going their way to make it to the Playoffs.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The Titans showed grit and courage against the Warriors to earn three points from the tie. Ankit Beniwal (9 points) and Rajnish (7 points) were the stars for the Titans who still have just one win in the entire season.</p><p><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The first half was a cagey, low-scoring affair played at a very slow pace. Bengal captain Maninder Singh didn't have his usual influence on the mat as Titans defenders tackled him aggressively. The Telugu team also struggled in their raids with Rajnish and Adarsh failing to fetch points for their team.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The Titans inched closer to an all-out in the dying minutes of the first half, but Bengal Warriors produced two consecutive Super Tackles to shift the balance. The four points from the tackles helped Bengal take the 14-12 lead at half-time.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The Titans started the second half with a five-point raid (2 for out-of-bounds, 1 for touch and 2 for all-out) as Ankit Beniwal removed all the Warriors on the mat. That gave the Titans a four-point lead. But Maninder Singh was in no mood to let the Titans run away with the match. He produced a three-point Super Raid in the 6th minute after the restart and followed it with a 2-point raid.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Maninder secured his Super 10 to continue the fight back to the Titans. The captain inspired other members of the Bengal team with substitute Rahul effective in the defence. Manoj Gowda also chipped in with raid points as Bengal levelled the scores at 27-27 with five minutes on the clock.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Bengal used that momentum to clinch an all-out with three minutes remaining to get a three-point lead. To make matters worse for Titans, their raider Rajnish got a yellow card for dissent. But Ankit Beniwal immediately got a two-point raid for the Titans, and they followed it up with a successful tackle on Maninder Singh. That levelled the scores and the Telugu team decided to not risk in the final raid of the match.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>",

The cross for the goal was provided by Javier Hernandez who made room on the right flank and served the ball on a platter for the striker who tapped in from close range.</p><p>Looking for the equaliser, Hira Mondal took an attempt just before half-time but his left-footed strike went wayward. The first half ended with the Kalinga Warriors retaining their one-goal advantage. The restart saw more sluggish gameplay as neither side was able to find inspiration in the final third.</p><p>The best chance to score the equaliser fell to Antonio Perosevic two minutes before the hour mark. A long ball from deep saw the forward find room behind the defensive line but his volley had too much elevation. However, the Croatian made no mistake from a similar opportunity a few minutes later and scored the equaliser with a low finish into the bottom right corner.</p><p>Nevertheless, Odisha FC regained the lead ten minutes later through Javier Hernandez. The midfielder received a lay-off from Jonathas who turned from scorer to provider. The right-footed shot from the Spaniard took a slight deflection before swerving into the back of the net.</p><p>Javi looked to have scored another a few minutes later but Mondal managed to make a goal-line clearance to deny him the goal. The Red &amp; Gold Brigade had four minutes of added time to find the leveller for the second time which they eventually could not, allowing OFC to bag the three points.</p><p>Odisha FC face the reigning champions Mumbai City FC in their next match at the PJN Stadium on Sunday whereas SC East Bengal play an in-form Kerala Blasters FC at the Tilak Maidan Stadium on Monday.</p>",

Sivasankar revealed that 'he never did any favour to Swapna' and also added that 'he never knew the iPhone that was gifted to him by her was part of a bribe'.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Angered by this statement, Swapna said 'it was Sivasankar who destroyed her life and all what she knew, he also knew'.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">She also pointed out that he had told her that he will take voluntary retirement and settle down with her in the UAE.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">She said that it was with his help that she, along with her husband and children and their friend Sandip Nair, managed to sneak out of Kerala, when the gold smuggling case surfaced in July 2020, when the entire state was under massive Covid travel restrictions. Another revelation of hers was that of the two audio clips of hers, one which came out on the day she and her family were on the run to Bengaluru and another while in custody, she said, it was all stage managed and directed by Sivasankar and others.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Incidentally, it's in this revelation, while she was in custody, that she said in presence of two women police officers she was asked to give a clean chit to Vijayan, and to say that she was being pressurised by the central agencies to implicate Vijayan. Swapna further said she was told and if she did so, she would be made an approver in the case. After this, the Kerala Police registered a case against the ED officials, but the Kerala High Court quashed that.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">Meanwhile, the other central agencies -- Customs and Intelligence Bureau have also registered cases supplementary to the gold smuggling case and in all these Swapna is an accused and now out on bail.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">And according to sources in the know of things, these agencies are also examining the fresh revelations and are likely to give her notice to appear before them to find out more.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(139, 138, 138);\">On the political front, the ruling CPI-M has been jolted by the revelations. While the Congress and the BJP slammed Vijayan, the CPI-M's only reaction was they will go by what Sivasankar said and dismissed Swapna's allegations as baseless.</span></p>",

In railway, now there is no unmanned railway crossing, which was one of the main reasons for accidents in the past, he said.</p><p>Citing example of development in last seven years, the BJP MP said the Railways has set up wi-fi facility at 10,000 railway stations and the students of nearby stations are using this facility for downloading material for their studies.

    "subHeading": "",
    "description": "<p>Be it CBSE, ICSE or any other state board, board exams are considered to be the most important phase of a student’s academic career. Sometimes the marks obtained in the board exams play a crucial role in deciding the whole future of a student’s life. Board examinations create a lot of panic and stress among students who are going to appear for the exams. Some feel extremely terrified while others remain tensed.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though a student would have spent the whole year effortlessly preparing for exams, but the pressure of the examinations leads students to make some common mistakes while attempting the board exams. There is no doubt that the key to excel any exam is hard work and tough preparation, but to score well in the exam, avoiding certain mistakes is equally important.</p><p>Things you must do after getting exam paper in board exams</p><p>Here, we are enlisting some most common mistakes which students make while writing the board eaxm:</p><p>1. Not utilizing 15 minute reading time properly</p><p>Students going to attempt the CBSE board exam are given 15 minutes time before they start writing the exam. These 15 minutes are allotted to take make a strategy to attempt the paper well in time. Instead most of the students make a mistake by simply reading the questions and not deciding a sequence in which they are to be answered.</p><p>2. Fail to understand the exact question behind a question</p><p>Exam stress and nervousness in students reduces their thinking ability. Out of fear and hurry to attempt the paper in time, they read a question quickly and start writing the answer without knowing what actually has been asked in the question. Eventually they write an answer in which they missed the actual fact or concept.</p><p>3. Not taking care of the word limit for each answer</p><p>Mostly students have a mindset that longer the answer, more will be the marks given to it. This is completely untrue. Examiners only look for the meaningful answers which include the important facts and crisp knowledge. They get irritated by the long essay type answers in which they struggle to find the key point. Moreover, spending large time on writing a wrong answer will ultimately leave you with less time to cover all remaining questions.</p><p>Importance of word limit in board exams</p><p>4. Lack of time management</p><p>Time management is crucial for acing the board exams. Even knowing this fact very well, students still fail to manage time while writing the exam. Again the credit goes to exam stress and nervousness due to which students forget about the time limit and word limit they are allocated for attempting questions of different weightage. They should plan in advance that how much time is to be dedicated to each question and category.</p><p>Tips for time management during CBSE board exam</p><p>5. Copying incorrect data</p><p>Sometimes students copy the data given in the question paper incorrectly specially, in the numerical questions and then solve the question resulting in wrong answer which will ultimately lead to a zero score in that question though you had written the whole procedure and calculations correctly. Students should take extra care as it might save a couple of marks in the exam.</p><p>6. Leaving the easy questions for last hour</p><p>Most of the students have an idea to attempt the difficult questions first and then write the easy questions in last which is not always a good idea. Students must answer those questions first which thay think can be answered easily. This way, student will secure some sure marks in the exam. On the other hand, if a student picks the difficult questions first then he/she may end up spending a lot of time thinking for those questions, leaving little or no time for the ones which could have earned him/her more marks.</p><p>7. Miss to write proper units in answers</p><p>Students often miss to write the proper units in answers wherever required. Soemtimes they are asked to write the answer in a converted unit which they miss due to panic and hurry to finish the exam.</p><p>Each single unit if missed will lead to a loss of a half mark which is really important while calculating the overall percentage.</p><p>So, these were some mistakes which students often make while writing on eof the most important exam of their life, the CBSE Board Exam. Students can avoid these mistakes by keeping calm, alert and focused in the examination hall. Stress and fear are your biggest enemies, maintain a fair distance with them. Stay positive and confident.</p><p>Good luck for exams!</p><p>—The Hawk Features</p><p><br></p>",

President Vucic should put himself in the shoes of Albanian Kosovars and ask:</p><p><br></p><p>Why would they ever surrender their independence and freedom to a country that has systematically discriminated, abused, and treated them as second-class citizens not worthy of equality before the law?</p><p><br></p><p>Why would they subjugate themselves to the whims of a country that has waged merciless war and rained havoc and destruction on them from which they have yet to recover?</p><p><br></p><p>Why would they forfeit their independence to a country that has committed horrifying war crimes—summarily executing more than 10,000 innocent boys and men, raping over 20,000 girls and women, and inflicting untold pain, agony, and shame on their families—from which they still suffer?</p><p><br></p><p>Why would they abandon their independence to a country that still refuses to reveal the burial sites of nearly 2,000 missing men, women, and children; a country that lacks the moral courage to admit to committing war crimes which were blatant and clear for everyone else to see?</p><p><br></p><p>Why would a people with a different religion, cultural heritage, history, and language agree to subordinate itself to a country with which it has little—values and aspirations—in common?</p><p><br></p><p>These painful feelings toward Serbia and the indelible psychological scars the war left on every Kosovar only deepened their rejection of Belgrade. Neither Vucic nor any of his successors will ever be in a position to mitigate these deep-seated impediments unless Serbia recognizes Kosovo’s independence and understands that it cannot change what has become an irreversible reality.</p><p><br></p><p>The failure to withdraw recognition</p><p>Over the years, successive Serbian governments embarked on a campaign to persuade many countries to withdraw their recognition of Kosovo. This has been a dismal failure. While Serbia’s Foreign Ministry last March claimed that 18 countries had either fully withdrawn recognition or were redefining their positions on Kosovo, several of those derecognitions are disputed, according to Balkan Insight, and those who did are mostly small African and Pacific states who enjoy little or no sway on the international scene, including Suriname, Burundi, and Papua New Guinea. Currently, Kosovo is recognized by 115 countries, the latest of which is Israel.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no military option</p><p>President Vucic knows only too well that there is no military option to force Kosovo to forsake its independence. Although every Albanian Kosovar will fight to their last breath to deny Serbia such a victory, NATO would immediately step in and conduct an aerial onslaught as it did in the 1998-1999 war, which ended after a 78-day bombing campaign. The war also ended President Slobodan Milosevic’s horrifyingly repressive rule over the then-Yugoslav province. NATO continues to guarantee Kosovo’s national security, and Vucic is not about to test NATO’s commitment.</p><p><br></p><p>Inability to exert economic pressure</p><p>Kosovo does not depend economically on Serbia and hence no Serbian government can now or at any time in the future exert economic pressure to force Kosovo’s hand. Kosovo can import any products from other countries, including the EU, Turkey, China, and many others. This being the case, Kosovo can even impose tariffs on goods imported from Serbia, as it has done in the past. Therefore, the lack of Serbian economic leverage allows Kosovo to play hard ball without risking weakening its economy, as we have seen previously.</p><p><br></p><p>Depriving Kosovo of EU integration</p><p>It is true that Serbia’s refusal to recognize Kosovo prevents the latter from joining the EU, as integration is contingent upon ending the conflict and reaching mutual recognition—but that also prevents Serbia from joining the EU. As a result, Russia’s President Putin is seizing the opportunity to lure Serbia into the Russian orbit by selling arms, which of necessity requires Russian military trainers on Serbian soil. Ironically, though Vucic knows that Serbia’s future growth and prosperity rests with the EU, he is still risking his country’s national interest by refusing to recognize Kosovo’s independence. Meanwhile he is trapping himself in Putin’s web, who is determined to weaken the EU and prevent Serbia from ever becoming a member state in the alliance.</p><p><br></p><p>Vucic should look at himself in the mirror and ask if there is any prospect now or at any time in the future to restore Kosovo as a Serbian province. If he is true to himself, he would know that there is no such prospect. It is time for him to muster the moral courage and demonstrate statesmanship by charting a new path that would advance the causes of both his country as well as Kosovo.</p><p><br></p><p>There are several measures Vucic can take before recognizing Kosovo to prepare the public to accept the inevitable:</p><p><br></p><p>a) End the public narrative that promotes the idea that Kosovo is a Serbian province;</p><p>b) Formally terminate the campaign to persuade countries that have recognized Kosovo to withdraw their recognition;</p><p>c) Begin a normalization process with Kosovo in many fields, including trade, cultural exchange, free movement of goods and services, academic exchanges, and religious discussions between Serbian Orthodox priests and imams, among other measures;</p><p>d) Cooperate in the search for missing persons to bring closure to the thousands of families who are still agonizing over the loss of their loved ones;</p><p>e) Initiate and maintain regular contact between Serbian and Kosovar officials, beginning with inviting Kosovo’s Prime Minister Kurti to Belgrade for discussions.</p><p><br></p><p>Following a period of two to three years of reconciliation, Vucic or his successor should follow the German example and admit to war crimes to allow for a national healing of both peoples. Only then can both sides tackle other conflicting issues, mainly the state of affairs of Serbians living in Kosovo, water distribution, and borders, as long as it is all done in the context of an independent Kosovo that Serbia will come to recognize.</p><p><br></p><p>Many will say that regardless of how cogent this argument may be, Serbia will never embrace it. Well, this may well be so for now. But I challenge any Serbian to show me how the dynamic of the conflict will change to advance a new realistic alternative that Kosovo can accept, short of recognition of its independence?</p><p><br></p><p>It is time to end this agonizing conflict that does nothing but needlessly deepen the schism between the two countries. Instead, they should live, grow, and prosper as good neighbors in peace, allowing the next generation of Serbians and Kosovars to blossom together and leave the ugly chapter of their parents’ experience behind.</p><p><br></p><p>___________</p><p><strong>*Dr. Alon Ben-Meir is a retired professor of international relations at the Center for Global Affairs at NYU.

She said the dues of sugarcane farmers across the country amounts to Rs 14000 crore and it could have been easily settled if Rs 16000 crore spent to buy two aeroplanes for the Prime Minister was utilised for that purpose. \"The country went through its worst crisis during the second wave of corona as the Centre exported both oxygen and vaccines to foreign countries,\" she said. She said the budget had nothing for the common man in it. \"I was told that diamond has become cheap but medicines costlier. Under the BJP government only the prime minister\"s industrialist friends have thrived and prospered,\" the leader alleged. She advised people not to be taken in by the promises being made by political parties, and exhorted them to ask for their “roadmap” if they had to change their lives and improve their lot. She said the party\"s manifesto has been named ‘Pratigya Patra’ as each commitment made in it will be fulfilled if the Congress is voted to power. She also spoke of her family\"s long ties with Uttarakhand. \"You know our family\"s long ties with Uttarakhand. My father, uncle, brother and son studied here,\" she said.</p><p>&nbsp;—PTI&nbsp;</p>",

    "postText": "Redistribution, But Not At The Cost Of Growth\n",
    "subHeading": "",
    "description": "<p>In the years since Independence, redistribution of wealth took priority over economic growth in India. However, the redistribution policies failed to make a serious dent in poverty levels, and kept economic growth subdued. While the liberalisation efforts of the early 90s led to an explosion in wealth creation and a substantial reduction in poverty, the reform agenda lost steam in the coming decades. Building on the impressive growth brought on as a result of reforms and increases in infrastructure spending, large scale redistributive policies were launched in India in the late-2000s. However, as the economy slowed down in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, the scale of government spending became unsustainable.&nbsp;</p><p>This is not to say redistribution should not be pursued. However, the means through which redistribution is undertaken is crucial. Cash transfers, progressive taxation and investments in human capital are the key instruments through which redistribution is undertaken, according to an IMF paper. There are of course, limits through which the first and second instruments can be utilised. For instance, take the early 1970s, where the highest personal income tax bracket was in excess of 95%. In a progressive taxation system, efforts must be made to increase government revenues through a widening tax base, and not through increasing marginal tax rates. Similarly, cash transfers, while important, must be accompanied by efforts to increase access to government benefits &amp; services. Investment in human capital must also be regularly monitored and evaluated, not in terms of inputs alone, but also in outputs and outcomes.</p><p>Large scale redistribution programmes come with a fiscal cost. Government revenues can either come from tax revenues or non-tax revenues. Tax revenues form a lion’s share of revenues in India. Tax revenues, in turn are crucially linked to the overall health of the economy. The logic is simple, as people earn more, more taxes are collected. Important also is the tax collection mechanism, which should encourage voluntary compliance. Deficit financing is employed when government expenditures are greater than revenues. This means that the government is borrowing money from markets to fund their expenditures. This is what has been termed as the fiscal deficit.</p><p>Now that we have established that the state of the economy is crucial in determining tax collections, we can infer that to increase tax collections, boosting the economy, i.e., increasing the size of the economic pie is crucial. Consider the case of the Nordic Countries.&nbsp;</p><p>These have been consistently cited as the best places to live. Yet, their economies are amongst the most dynamic as well. These countries have consistently ranked high on the Economic Freedom Index, which measures the degree of economic freedom in a nation. New Zealand, which has been ranked at the top, both in the Economic Freedom and Ease of Doing Business Indices, has been lauded for its strong social security nets. Therefore, key to running sustainable and transformative redistribution policies is a robust &amp; dynamic economy. Crucial structural reforms, governance reforms and regulatory reforms have been undertaken by the current government to formalise the Indian economy and unlock long standing&nbsp;inefficiencies. A new tax regime has been rolled out, both in direct and indirect taxes. The new system promotes voluntary compliance and trust, compared to the adversarial regime that had built up in India’s taxation system. Faceless assessment and appeals, reduction in corporate &amp; personal income tax rates, a resolution mechanism for pending disputes, GST with input tax credit are testament to the fact that a rules based, voluntary compliance system of taxation is being ushered in.</p><p>In India, we have seen all three instruments of redistribution policies at play now and in the past as well. However, access remained a key hurdle. The money being spent by the government was not reaching its intended beneficiaries. I remember in my early days as an officer, where the then Prime Minister said that for every Rupee spent by the government, 85p was leaked. There has been a paradigm change since then, primarily over the past few years. A key differentiator over the past few years has been a focus on service delivery, accountability and transparency, enabled through technology. Addressing issues of access are of immense importance in combating inequality. Access to healthcare, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, cooking gas, internet, houses and finance are just some areas in which giant leaps have been taken. The record speaks for itself. By addressing issues of access, a huge impediment towards greater wealth and income equality has been overcome. This has been achieved without any substantial increase in marginal taxation. Large scale cash transfers are also taking place, through the PM-KISAN scheme and through direct benefit transfers (DBTs). Human capital has also been receiving due attention. The world’s largest health insurance scheme is run in India. The focus has shifted towards measuring quality of education, achieved access to education. A new National Education Policy has been launched, the first in over three decades. Much has been done in India to battle inequality over the past years, with the emphasis being on improving access to government benefits and services. This has been achieved not through any substantially larger increase in expenditure alone, but through a combination of many factors. First, budgetary were increased. However, this was accompanied by governance reforms that promoted accountability and transparency. Technology played a crucial role as an enabler of robust monitoring and evaluation systems. The result was efficient delivery of services to the bottom of the pyramid. At the same time, efforts have been made to boost the economy’s potential growth rate through a series of structural reforms, each of which addressed inherent inefficiencies in the economy. Redistribution and growth need not be competing policy goals. A robust economy is crucial in financing redistribution prog-rammes. In turn, these investments in redistribution have a multiplier effect on the economy in the long run.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;—The Hawk</p><p><br></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>New York (The Hawk):&nbsp;</strong>Trump was planning to hold a press conference during which he was expected to repeat lies for the hundredth time that the election in 2020 was stolen, that the insurrection a year ago was actually peaceful, and that he – not Biden – is the duly-elected president. He canceled the press conference at the urging of the GOP and now is expected to instead spread these lies at his Arizona rally next week. He will, needless to say, remain true to himself and deny any wrongdoing and blame the Democrats for persistently undermining his presidency as well as for all the ills that face America today.</p><p>Trump is uniquely dangerous; he wants to solidify his absolute control over the Republican Party, rouse his followers, instill hatred of the Democrats, and of course raise enough money for his re-election campaign should he decide to run again. Moreover, the Arizona rally will be his first foray into the mid-term elections designed to rouse the rank-and-file of the Republican Party to recapture the House and the Senate as the forerunner to the 2024 election.</p><p>The tragic aspect of the Trump phenomenon is that the elected leaders of the Republican Party continue to follow him religiously, regardless of the fact that he is corrupt, was defeated in re-election as an incumbent, was impeached twice, and faces several criminal charges. Indeed, no former president in American history has been able to maintain his grip on his party the way Trump has. And no Republican Party has abdicated its moral and constitutional responsibilities and willingly succumbed to a deranged egomaniac, misogynist, and habitual liar. How could this happen, and why? The answer is Trump’s and the Republicans’ voracious lust for power.</p><p>The Republican Party has become a minority party and there is no circumstance under which the party can win nationally in a free and fair election. Demographically, Black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, and other minorities currently represent more than 40 percent of the American population, and it is estimated that by 2045 they will become the majority, who largely vote for Democrats. Collectively, even at the present they can deny the Republican Party from ever capturing the White House again if they go out and vote en masse.</p><p>The Republican Party faces two choices: one is to adapt to the changing demographic reality and develop socio-economic programs that respond to the needs of people of color (POC) without sacrificing much of their conservative ideology. This includes lowering taxes, particularly for those who earn less than $200,000 a year, immigration reform, which the Republican Party has long-acknowledged needs addressing and will help in outreach especially to Hispanic voters, and supporting minority small business owners with tax breaks and other financial incentives, which won’t incur further government spending.</p><p>The second choice is to prevent or make it extremely difficult for POC to exercise their right to vote through a variety of deplorable measures. One state after another is passing discriminatory rules, including gerrymandering districts on racial lines, restricting early voting, which disproportionately affects Black Americans who are more likely than any other ethnic or racial group to cast early ballots (whether in-person or by mail and absentee ballots), enacting voter ID laws even though voter impersonation fraud is exceedingly rare and those who don’t have valid ID are disproportionately POC, and empower state legislators to invert their own elections and manipulate the electoral college to their advantage.</p><p>Sadly, if not tragically, the Republican Party went for the latter option. Many Republicans simply believe that POC are illegitimate citizens and should not be able to vote and have the power, as they fear accurately or otherwise, to enact laws against whites, the way whites have enacted discriminatory laws against POC. America, from their perspective, was founded by white people, and the thought that the US is becoming browner every passing day scares them to the core. They needed a leader who is a bigot, shameless, and crude, with no scruples and no morals, but audacious—a performer with the ability to sway large audiences with his lies and sneering face. The Republicans need him to promote their agenda without fear of public repercussions, and he needs the party to satisfy his ego in order to exercise raw power, and also grant him its full support should he decide to run again.</p><p>We are still reeling from the violent storming of the Capitol on January 6 to prevent the peaceful transfer of power. Trump, who incited his followers to attack the Capitol, was ready to shatter our democracy only to bask in his authoritarian impulse. What does that say about the Republican Party, which largely ignored or downplayed the insurrection in its determination to seize power and chose chaos and violence over voting, even at the expense of tearing our democratic institutions apart? How ironic and deeply troubling that 52 percent of Republicans say that the insurrectionists were trying to protect democracy.</p><p>The most ominous note that must be repeated loud and clear is that the party under the leadership of Trump will incite violence should they fail to win the 2022 election, as anyone who carefully listens to the many utterances spewed by reckless Republicans leaders can discern with clarity. In that context, although Trump during his rally will not openly encourage his followers to resort to violence to undo the result of the election, the message to them will be loud and clear.</p><p>It is hard to exaggerate the transformation of the Republican Party since the rise of Trump in 2016, from a patriotic party that stood for democracy to a white supremacist party willing to destroy it only to stay in power. Many thousands of Republican leaders should follow the footsteps of Representative Liz Cheney, who stood up against Trump and in favor of the truth, and still rescue our democracy by accepting reality and being truthful with their followers.</p><p>The election of Biden gave the country hope of preserving our democracy and attending to the political and social malaise that swept the nation, especially during Trump’s tenure in the White House. But to address these ills, the Democrats must spare no effort to hold onto the House and Senate in the 2022 mid-term election, as these will be the most consequential in more than a century. Indeed, should the Republicans manage to recapture both chambers of Congress, our democracy will slide toward the precipice of disintegration while authoritarianism creeps in, and Biden’s agenda will be shattered.</p><p>The Democrats have their work cut out for them. They must rise in unison, which is bitterly still missing, stop short of nothing to strengthen voting rights, prevent the appointment of partisans to subvert the election, fight political corruption at every level, make political power decreasingly dependent on money, get out the vote, and eliminate the filibuster to pass the voting rights bill. Furthermore, they must hold accountable the traitors behind the insurrection on January 6, including Trump.</p><p>Democrats and the millions of law-abiding Republicans should sound the alarm before it’s too late, and never waver to preserve and protect America’s 244-year-old democracy that served as a beacon of hope and freedom to the global community.</p>",

It was as if the Congress was out in deep wilderness with no future due to numerous reasons many of which were categorically pointed out in the public by the Congress-opponents by numbers. Then, it really seemed \"no future for the Congress\".&nbsp;</p><p>Its not so at all for the Congress, point out political observers in the \"over politicised capital now buzzing with Congress, the must for governance with immediate effect\". About Randeep Surjewala: A 2021-reckoner with 2040 via years from now, he is forward looking, Congress-aligned to the core. He has astute managerial skills in keeping media of all hues \"in correct check\", observe analysers appreciatingly, forbid/pre-empt them from spreading false canards against the party unlike before him when they not only wrote off Congress but mentioned it in utmost pusillanimous manner without even bothering \"to cross check before writing or showing\" from the party. The Congress then resembled a sheer malevolent parasite, recall observers. According to them, its not so at all today, thanks to determined doggedness of Randeep. He ensures all on Congress published or shown is \"correct\" and not, \"falsehood, rumours, canards\". Effect of that: Anti-Congress parties now 24x7 take cognizance of what the Congress does/says, even comment on them sheepishly. Thus fully successful is Rahul's Randeep liaison to the hilt...</p>",

Maybe, it was Almighty's decree that Shri Narendra Modi would take over&nbsp;as Prime Minister of India and liberate the people of Jammu &amp; Kashmir from the shackles of Article 370 and 35-A.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Following the changeover and the&nbsp;new administrative and constitutional arrangements coming in place, Jammu &amp; Kashmir has not only embarked on a fast-track journey of development but also attained liberation from the mental barriers that made the people feel differently as compared to their counterparts in the rest of India and likewise, the rest of India also got conditioned to treat Jammu &amp; Kashmir differently.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">With integration having taken place in toto at all levels, the people of Jammu &amp; Kashmir today are upbeat at the prospect of realising their dream of becoming an essential component of Modi's New India and thereby also its beneficiaries.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">This \"Imaginative\" Jammu &amp; Kashmir has not only made an effective departure from the unhealthy legacy of the past but has also learnt to nurture the same aspirations as the rest of India.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Today, Jammu &amp; Kashmir has embarked on a new journey of development. 170 Central laws, which were not applicable earlier, have now been made applicable. At the same time, all the Central laws are applied in the UT of Jammu &amp; Kashmir.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Many laws, like Child Marriage Act, Right to Education, RTI and Land Reforms are also effective now. Valmiki, Dalit and Gorkha communities, living here for decades, also now enjoy rights at par with the other residents. Now the local residents and the residents of other States, enjoy the same rights. Out of the 334 State laws, 164 laws have been repealed and 167 laws have been adapted, according to the Indian Constitution. For the people living in areas adjoining the International Border, a provision of 3% reservation in jobs and educational institutions has been effected.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">As per the recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission, the UT of Jammu &amp; Kashmir and UT of Ladakh have been sanctioned a grant of Rs. 30,757 crore and Rs. 5,959 crores respectively, during 2020-21.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Last year, the first ever elections of Gram panchayats and Zila panchayats were conducted successfully. After many years, Panchayat elections were held in the year 2018 and there was a turnout of 74.1%. In 2019 Block Development Council Elections were held for the first time and the voter turnout was 98.3 Percentage. There was record participation in the recently held district level elections as well.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">51.7 lakh beneficiaries have been verified in Jammu &amp; Kashmir under Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Scheme. Under this scheme, 2.24 lakh treatments have been authorised in the hospitals of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, for which, an amount of Rs. 223 Crores has been authorised. Under the PM Kisan Scheme, 12.03 lakh beneficiaries have been included so far.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Domicile law has been applied and the way has been paved for the resettlement of Kashmiri Pandits ousted from the Kashmir valley in 1990, with the work on provision of 6000 jobs and 6000 transit accommodations, in progress.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">For the cultivation of apples, a market intervention scheme has been implemented. DBT payment's and transportation by Central procurement Agency under the scheme have stabilized the prices of apples.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Kashmiri Kesar has received G.I. tag. Now Kashmiri Saffron is reaching even the Northeastern States. Ukhu village of Pulwama is all set to receive the tag of \"Pencil Wala Gaon\".</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Srinagar's long-awaited Ram Bagh flyover was opened. IIT Jammu got its own campus and the work of AIIMS, Jammu has also started. The wait for the Atal Tunnel ended when the Prime Minister dedicated it to the nation. Jammu Semi Ring Road and 8.45 km long new Banihal Tunnel, will be opened this year.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The incidents of terror have significantly declined and there is a new found atmosphere of peace and security in the valley. Tourism is showing a rapid upward trend.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Work on Shahpur - Kandi Dam project, which was stalled for 40 years, has been started again. Ratle hydropower project work is also being resumed.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">It is for the first time that under an industrial promotion scheme of Government of India, industrial development will be taken to the block level in Jammu &amp; Kashmir. Under the new central scheme, incentives worth Rs. 28,400 crores over the next 15 years will open new doors of development in the State.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">A part from employment generation in the primary sector, another 4.5 Lakh direct and indirect employment is expected to result from the scheme in agriculture, horticulture, sericulture, fisheries, animal husbandry and dairy industry.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Jammu &amp; Kashmir today is marching ahead in rapid strides.

Teachers of India in the 2030s, you willnot be replaced by technology. You will be a vibrant community having the following 11 characteristics.</p><p>You will be curriculum-literate: Curriculum is the means to achieve learning standards and includes everything from lesson plans, to timetables, competencies, content, pedagogy, assessment, subjects, skills, art, sports, etc.You will have an expert understanding of every aspect of the quality curriculum and will use it to achieve student learning outcomes.</p><p>You will use the mother tongue/regional language to deliver curriculum: You will treat all languages as equal and ensure the promotion of Indian languages in classrooms.</p><p>You will have student-centric joyful classrooms and focus on whole brain thinking: You understand that thelogical, linear, and analytical, type of skills of the left brain and the empathy, design, seeing the big-picture capabilities of the right brain need to be equally worked upon.&nbsp;You will integrate art, sports, story-telling, skilling, computational thinking, scientific temperwith the rigour of the subject.You will adopt inquiry and projects based learning, design thinking, problem-solving, etc. which are self-directed. These areattributes that students will need in the future to succeed. The importance of student voice and choicewill be recognised in this manner.You will bring back the joy of learning to your classroom through innovative pedagogies.</p><p>You will help learn how to learn and co-learn: You no longer teach to the test. You no longer turn your back to the students and unabatedly continue to write on the blackboard or encourage rote-memorisation. Learning is no longer limited to the confines of a textbook, a traditional school day, a typical test, or a summative exam - thanks to the internet. You teach your students how to become effective learners and not just passive guzzlers of information. You use audios, videos, podcasts, graphic novels, internet, TV, radio, newspapers, story books, etc. as tools for learning. In the home, in the community, and in the world at large, you will co- learn alongside your students. You are a lifelong learner.</p><p>You will skill learners through experiences:Four crucial 21 st century learning skills of creativity, critical thinking, collaboration and communication will need to be imbibed by each learner to thrive in tomorrow’s dynamic workplace.&nbsp;For this, you will integrate content and your strong subject knowledge with real life experiences to help learners cultivate the skills, attitudes, behaviour and literacies required for the future world. Students will study physics with philosophy, political science with music, mathematics with geography, etc. requiring you to be adept at exploring the inter-relationships and connections between subjects. Imagine how creative your profession will become! You will develop students as innovators and producers of knowledge: At a very early age, your students will have the skills and competencies to be able to search for information, make sense of it, sieve the facts from claims/opinions/falsities, consolidate and produce more knowledge to create a just, humanitarian and an equitable world. You will inspire them to innovate and co-create through your own proclivity for forward thinking, collaboration, flexibility, creativity and adaptability to everything new.&nbsp;</p><p>You will help them learn new technologies and keep abreast yourself: You will be the one who first teaches the child how to use technology for fanning her curiosity and learning! And the hunger that you create will then become a lifelong yearning in the child and in you to learn newer and newer technologies.</p><p>You will nurture the ‘Jad se Jag tak’ (from the roots to the globe) connection: You will teach your students about our heritage, culture, traditions, practises, literature, languages, ‘lok vidya’ and at the same time you will shape them into global citizens. You will be the means of understanding their roles and responsibilitiesin society, and for instilling a sense of pride and respect for the nation.</p><p>You will lead by example: In all areas of the curriculum, whether it be physical fitness, or multilingualism, an appreciation of the arts, ethical behaviour, a sensitivity towards inclusion, diversity, or environment, you will be the change that you will want to see in your students. You will act as Guide and Mentor: Instead of trying to be a Harphanmaula and keeper of all information, teachers will guide, mentor, empower and support students to proceed in their own unique areas of interest. They will prepare them for the worst and capable of the best.</p><p>You will unhesitatingly and appropriately respond to shifts: You will continuously and readily respond to the economical, technological, and societal shifts that will happen at a breakneck pace. You will teach the learners to acquire competencies for jobs that are yet to be created, with the help of technologies that you have yet to learn, in a society that is constantly evolving, transforming and reshaping itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>—The Hawk</p>",

    "description": "<p>Most countries around the world whether big or small, developed or developing, pursue a space programme of their own or in collaboration with advanced countries. Most aspects of these programmes are in the public domain and are targeted towards scientific and human advancement.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The spectre of a space was between the US and Russia came to an end with signing of the START Treaty in 1991 between the two. However, China has emerged as a country, which pursues a very secretive space programme and may force the mankind in a space war and global dominance.</p><p><br></p><p>There is enough evidence to prove that China's space programme is targeted to move ahead and use space to dominate not only the US but also the rest of the planet. In terms of the US national security, and for the rest of the world also, China's space capabilities have been defined as one of the most significant future threats to the global peace.</p><p><br></p><p>China's plans were outlined very clearly when shortly after becoming president in March 2013, Xi Jinping made his ambitions for China's space power very clear. \"Developing the space program and turning the country into a space power is the space dream that we have continuously pursued\", he said.</p><p><br></p><p>\"The space dream is part of the dream to make China stronger.\"</p><p><br></p><p>China's aim is to become the world's leading space power by 2045. In a 2017 editorial, China Daily had said: \"China will become an all-round world-leading country in space equipment and technology. By 2045, it will be able to carry out man-computer coordinated space exploration on a large scale.\"</p><p><br></p><p>US concerns</p><p><br></p><p>The advances and secret dimension of the Chinese space programme have been duly noted and concerns have been raised by the United States in this regard. The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission in its 2019 Annual Report to Congress stated that \"China is taking steps to establish a commanding position in the commercial launch and satellite sectors relying in part on aggressive state-backed financing that western market-driven companies cannot match\".</p><p><br></p><p>US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, in his written testimony prior to his confirmation hearing in January 2021, declared that Chinese and Russian space activities present serious and growing threats to American national security interests. Chinese and Russian military doctrines also indicate that they view space as critical to modern warfare and consider the use of counter-space capabilities as both a means of reducing US military effectiveness and for winning future wars.</p><p><br></p><p>A Pentagon report in 2020 stated that the PRC continues to strengthen its military space capabilities, despite its public stance against the weaponisation of space.... the PRC is developing electronic warfare capabilities such as satellite jammers.... and China probably intends to pursue additional anti-satellite weapons capable of destroying satellites.</p><p><br></p><p>Chinese space programme</p><p><br></p><p>A significant aspect of China's space initiative is the Beidou Navigation Satellite system (BDS), a global navigation satellite system that provides positioning, navigation and timing, in addition to data communication. The Chinese military has created the programme in order not to be dependent on the US-controlled GPS network. A report by the Jamestown Foundation says: \"In recent years, the PRC has actively sought to promote the image of Beidou as a civilian-led programme intended primarily for commercial and scientific purposes, however, the program is under overall military direction, with the People's Liberation Army in charge of Beidou's development.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Beidou can also be termed as China's \"Space Silk Road\", which expands China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and its land-based and sea-based versions to space. Beidou makes countries participating in the BRI, dependent on China for precision navigation and other space based services.</p><p><br></p><p>Malcolm Davis of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute wrote in 2017 that, \"Chinese provision of satellite communications, weather monitoring and earth observation add to this vision for a Space Silk Road that overarches and underpins the Belt and Road Initiative. By signing up to the BRI 'Space Information Corridor', the BRI states would become dependent on Chinese-provided space services. That would give Beijing greater power to influence the policy choices of those states, because it would control the vital space capabilities that sustain their economic growth\".</p><p><br></p><p>We have already seen the negative impact on countries like Sri Lanka and Brazil, which participated in the land and sea versions of the BRI.</p><p><br></p><p>The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission further expressed caution in its 2019 Annual Report thus, \"Beijing has specific plans not merely to explore space, but to industrially dominate the space.... Beijing uses its space programme to advance its terrestrial geopolitical objectives, including cultivating customers for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)... China's promotion of... the Beidou global navigation system under its 'Space Silk Road' is deepening participants' reliance on China for space-based services\".</p><p><br></p><p>China's \"Space Silk Road\", forms a very crucial part of its ambitious space goals. The commissions' report further states that China has already succeeded in undercutting some US and other foreign launch and satellite providers in the international market, threatening to hollow out these countries' space industrial bases... The aggressive pursuit of foreign technology and talent...continues to be central to this strategy and to China's space development goals in general.</p><p><br></p><p>China's Moon Programme</p><p><br></p><p>The China Daily in 2019 reported that \"the next steps in China's manned space programme will be manned exploration of the moon. We will set up bases on the moon to conduct scientific operations, expand a habitable place for mankind and gain experience and expertise for deep-space expeditions beyond the moon. The long-term goal is to send humans to Mars\".</p><p><br></p><p>Another worrisome development is Chinese cooperation with Russia in this regard. In March, China signed an agreement with Russia to work together to build a research station on the moon, which will carry out research on exploration and crucially, utilisation of the moon. Already in 2013, China launched its first lunar rover to explore the surface of the moon, hoping, among other things, to discover rare earth minerals, which are reportedly abundant on the moon. China's Chang'e 5 lunar probe mission landed on the moon and brought back geological samples to China, which became just the third country to do so after the US and Russia.</p><p><br></p><p>In view of these developments it is a foregone conclusion that China will also move ahead to use space to dominate not only the US but also the rest of the world. Its plans for the future wars are space-based, in addition to utilising its large stockpile of surface to air missiles, ballistic and cruise missiles â€“ which can strike from 500 to 5,500 km, thus covering a major part of the globe, without putting its soldiers' boots on foreign soil and indeed it may not portend well.</p><p><br></p><p>(Asad Mirza is a political commentator based in New Delhi.

    "description": "<p><br></p><p><strong>New York (The Hawk):</strong>&nbsp;In July 2011, South Sudan became independent from Sudan following six years of autonomy and 20 years of brutal war. Only two years later, a mostly ethnic divide in the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, which led the independence movement for the country, pitted President Salva Kiir against his Vice President, Riek Machar. Their rival militias clashed, fueled by long-standing tension between the Dinka and Nuer, the country's largest and second largest ethnic groups respectively. Now, however, that the two sides have once again agreed on a peace accord based on power sharing, the question is how to solidify an accord that remains extremely fragile, especially following a merciless civil war that left deep scars and a powerful urge for revenge and retribution.</p><p>A brief review of the horrifying toll the war has exacted will point to the herculean task that lies ahead to alleviate the incomprehensible suffering the South Sudanese have experienced.</p><p>South Sudan descended into one of the most brutal civil wars in modern times. Currently, only Syria is suffering greater casualties and destruction than South Sudan. Nearly 400,000 lost their lives, and roughly 8.5 million are in need of humanitarian assistance. In addition, close to 1.5 million are internally displaced and 2.2 million are refugees; more than 1.9 million people, largely women and children, are acutely malnourished, while a significant part of the country plunged into famine.</p><p>Indeed, children have suffered the most. As many as 13,000 children were recruited by both sides as child soldiers, and girls as young as seven have been raped and burned alive in front of their parents. Rape is employed as a weapon of war and as an incentive for recruitment, with women abducted specifically to be used for this purpose. Pillaging washes the streets with blood, starvation and disease are rampant, and corruption has reached epic proportions.</p><p>The failure to stop these atrocities from recurring in many different countries points to how morally bankrupt these and other countries are, and how apathetic the international institutions have become, especially the United Nations Security Council. In addition, alliances such as the Arab League and the African Union have long since forfeited their commitment to ensuring peace, security, and economic progress for their member states, thereby surrendering their moral obligations to human rights to the corrupt realpolitik of the day.</p><p>Several agreements between the rival factions in South Sudan have been signed over the past few years, but fail to address the central issues of leadership and distribution of resources. The country still faces a plethora of national crises, including persistent low-level violence, poor governance, weak institutions, and a lack of law enforcement. Thus, it is critically important for the government to fully adhere to all the provisions of the accord with the support of the international community to hold the peace agreement together.</p><p>There are several critical measures that the South Sudanese government and the international community should undertake to ensure the country does not descend back to violence, which will leave no winners but only losers in its wake.</p><p>The new South Sudan government must first invest in healthcare, education, clean water, and agriculture rather than overspending on security. Moreover, the government should embark on real social and political reforms, including ethnic equality, freedom of religion, the right to vote, adherence to the rule of law, and freedom of the press and assembly. Additionally, the government must prevent any human rights violations while weeding out corruption, which is central to the country's future prosperity and growth. This can happen only by addressing ethnic conflicts through political discourse instead of reverting to violence.</p><p>Other critical measures include reconstituting the parliament, reforming the abusive national security service and intelligence, uniting the tens of thousands in rival militias into a single army, and preventing local violence from festering. In addition, South Sudanese elite, civil society, and religious leaders ought to be working together to buttress the government. And given that South Sudan is home to over 60 different ethnic groups, they must find a new bond, and create a nation based on a shared identity.</p><p>Finally, South Sudan needs to establish a legally binding and internationally monitored succession of power, which remains critical to prevent deadly rivalries. The country's leaders should broaden power sharing and under no circumstances settle on a winner-take-all approach in the upcoming 2022 election, to ensure continuity and a promising future for the country.</p><p>The international community has a critical role to play to prevent such calamities by not remaining silent and instead helping the South Sudanese government to build a sustainable peace. As Hannah Arendt wisely observed, \"Evil thrives on apathy and cannot survive without it.\" However, given years of conflict, economic insecurity, repeated flooding, the impact of COVID-19, and concern with conflicts over natural resources while the dry season rapidly approaches, every effort should be made to prevent renewed violence.</p><p>Given that South Sudan is lucrative in oil resources, nevertheless the oil industry is in disarray. Western oil companies should work with the South Sudanese government to export crude oil and refine oil for internal consumption. Where foreign aid is provided, it must be granted for specific projects, with monitoring and accountability enacted by international donors. The US in particular, which helped broker the independence of South Sudan, should play a direct role. President Biden, who is extremely in tune and sensitive to human right issues, will certainly be more disposed to helping South Sudan. More important however, is for the international community to wake up and quickly intercede to prevent this horrifying conflict from spinning once again out of control and not allow South Sudan to fall back into the abyss of human frailty.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>New York (The Hawk):&nbsp;</strong>Like many Americans, I have been observing Trump's rise to power with some perplexity, often asking myself how and why a man of his character became the President of the United States, which is viewed as the most powerful political office in the world. But out of a sense of fairness, I thought that he should be given a chance, as he may be able to rise to the occasion and prove me and others wrong.</p><p>Indeed, for someone who seeks adulation, reverence, admiration of his 'genius,' respect, and appreciation of his 'unlimited talents and expertise' on just about every subject, I wondered, why would he not use the power of the presidency to earn all that he desperately wants to be recognized for?</p><p>After all, despite his character flaws, he made it to the White House. And yet having reached the pinnacle of power, he still wants more, when in fact the presidency, regardless of constitutional constraints, provides him with all the power he needs to effect revolutionary constructive change—if he only willed it.</p><p>Over the past four years, I devoted over 50 of my weekly articles and essays to the Trump presidency, in a way chronologizing some of his statements, the issues he tackled, his policy initiatives, his ideological leanings, and certainly his appetite for making false statements, misrepresenting facts, and creating his own alternate reality.</p><p>Before long, I realized that this man is simply irredeemable. He has shown that he is plainly unfit to hold the office of the presidency, which carries an awesome power both domestically and internationally. He did not \"make America great again;\" he tarnished America's greatness for much of the world to see.</p><p>Many psychiatrists and psychologists who have analyzed his behavior, public utterances, and tweets have unanimously concluded that Trump is a psychopath, a pathological liar, uncompassionate, narcissist, greedy, and shallow. He sees things only in black and white, and never cares to understand the nuances of any issue before him.</p><p>Here lies Trump's sickness. In his world, the presidency is not enough to satisfy his ego and make up for his dismal failures and complete lack of self-confidence. He needs unchecked power—dictatorial power—so that no one can question his actions, motives, or agenda, however skewed or criminal they may be.</p><p>Sooner than later, Trump will leave office disgracefully, leaving behind the wreckage of a century, the extent of which none of his predecessors have remotely left in their wake. He stained the office of the presidency, as he brought nothing but shame and disdain to the most prestigious office in the land which is looked upon with awe and admiration around the world.</p><p>It will take years, and in some cases decades, to repair the extensive damage he inflicted on our country. We must now attend to healing our deep wounds that tore us apart before we can realize, once again, the American dream.</p><p>***********</p><p>Since I submitted the manuscript of the book nearly two months ago, Trump's behavior has become ever more astonishing. He has consistently delegitimized the elections, sabotaged the postal service in order to interfere with mail-in voting, which millions of Americans are turning to due to the coronavirus pandemic, and openly refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power should he lose the election (let alone commit to accepting the result should he lose).</p><p>This past week Trump contracted the coronavirus, along with many of those around him, a development that should not be at all surprising given his refusal to engage in social distancing or wear a mask, or any other preventative measures recommended by the CDC. Recklessness, stubbornness, arrogance and ineptitude have characterized him and his administration since the pandemic began, and there seems to be no bottom to his irresponsibility.</p><p>During the first presidential debate, Trump did everything he could to debase such an important part of the election process that allows the American public to hear what the candidates for the highest office in the land have to say. He interrupted former Vice President Biden nearly 130 times, made scores of misleading statements and said outright lies, and \"bragged\" about an economy in tatters. He spoke about the coronavirus in the past tense, while new infections and deaths continue to rise daily—over 7 million infected and over 210,000 dead.</p><p>To be sure, Trump behaved during the debate just the way Biden characterized him—a clown; unhinged, uncaring, and dismissive with an uncanny hostile demeanor. Millions of viewers just like me cringed in their seats, ashamed to have such a loose cannon, and an ignorant and self-conceited man once again a candidate for the presidency after four years of his disastrous performance.</p><p>It is now the responsibility of every American who is eligible to vote, who cares and loves this country, to say NO. No to Trump and his enablers in the Republican Party. The damage that he and his stooges have inflicted on our democracy and institutions is hard to assess. If he is given another four years, he will shatter every pillar on which this republic has rested, causing incalculable wounds from which we will not recover for decades.</p>",

And, Budget 2022 addresses this issue by seeking a leap forward for India through technology and innovation based economy which enriches itself by exploring India's unexplored potentials including the deep sea resources, he added.PM Modi has given us a statesmanly budget which addresses the next generation and not the next election and that is why, the critics and some sections of media are confused because they were anticipating election sops, said Dr Jitendra Singh.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The future economy is going to be the economy of ideas and the economy of imaginative innovation , said Dr Jitendra Singh and added, the Budget 2022 reflects futuristic vision of the Government headed by Narendra Modi visible in every initiative , whether it be Drone Shakti for Start-Ups, Kisan Drone 30% tax on virtual transfers, low carbon strategy etc.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">To those who say there are no jobs accruing from the budget, Dr Jitendra Singh said, they are prisoners of government salary job. Giving some examples, he said, increase in Capital Expenditure to Rs 7.2 lakh crore itself will generate atleastRs 3 lakh crore jobs while construction of 45,000 km highways worth over Rs 130,000 crore will also generate jobs.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Dr Jitendra Singh cited example of StartUpBoatlab youngsters who had been supported by his Ministry to put up Light Show during recent Beating Retreat ceremony and said the drones developed by them are going to be taken by Industry and that too is a source of income, possibly more than govt job. He said in Jammu region itself, the Ministries headed by him are supporting youth in Agriculture/Aroma and Dairy StartUps but unfortunately there is no awareness nor does the media report.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Referring to unexplored areas, Dr Jitendra Singh said, the allocation made in the union budget to Earth Sciences department was to the tune of Rs 2500 Cr that was in addition to 4000 crore already allocated to Deep Sea Mission . Elaborating further about unexplored potentials of the economy, he also made references to Deep Sea Mission and Space Missions to which the Government has given priority and that were neglected by previous governments.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Dr Jitendra Singh said, the Budget lays stress on chemical -free farming , sustainable start-ups startups, drone technology and various tech-based developments. He said that the Budget includes provisions for using drone technology in sectors like agriculture and Startups in form of ‘KisanDrones’ , ‘Drone Shakti’ and Drone-as-a-service(DrAAS) . All these offer abundant opportunities for Job generation across sectors. He further maintained that sustainable startups were a major focus area of the Union Budget as it provides better opportunities than Government Jobs . He added that the Government endeavoured to build an economy of ideas , innovation and futuristic thinking wherein there is an abundance of job opportunities. BJP President Ravinder Raina made the concluding remarks and ProfessorDipanker Sen from Jammu University gave his expert comments on the budget.</span></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>New York (The Hawk):&nbsp;</strong>The Anglo-Australian multinational company Rio Tinto – the largest iron ore mining company in the world – demolished two 46,000-year-old Aboriginal rock shelters in May. What is particularly disturbing about this event is that Rio Tinto was apparently acting entirely within the law, which is to say that this kind of tragic and wanton destruction will continue to happen unless stricter regulations are enacted. The sites were located on the ancestral lands of the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura, or PKKP, people in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Anthropological studies commissioned by Rio Tinto itself confirmed that the caves were of \"the highest archaeological significance,\" containing an \"enormous museum of information about [the PKKP people's] ancestors' work and lives.\"</p><p>The conflict between industry and heritage that we are witnessing today is of course not a new phenomenon. Indeed, in Australia, it has been a persistent problem since at least the early 1960s when the mining and extraction of iron ore in the Pilbara region began. But the struggle can and should be seen also within the larger context of the marginalization, subjugation and decimation of the Aboriginal peoples that has been the story of their ongoing plight since 1788 when British settlers began colonizing the Australian mainland. Not until 1965 did most Aboriginal Australians enjoy full citizenship or voting rights; and it would take six more years before they were included on the national census. Australia's indigenous people constitute only two percent of the population and yet are 28 percent of Australia's prisoner demographic.</p><p>The unrelenting destruction of indigenous heritage sites is entirely consistent with the same ideology that has driven Australia's aggressive campaign of deforestation. Both are expressions of one and the same policy of uncompromising colonization. Over the last 200 years Australia has lost 25 percent of its rainforest, 45 percent of open forest, and 32 percent of woodland forest. In fact, among developed countries Australia has one of the highest rates of deforestation, which has led to the annihilation of much of its native wildlife. Twenty percent of Australia's mammals, 7 percent of its reptiles, and 13 percent of its birds are listed as extinct, endangered or vulnerable. According to wilderness.org.au, 1,000 plant and animal species are presently at risk of extinction.</p><p>The obliteration of the Juukan Gorge caves certainly represents a devastating loss to the PKKP – but it is a tragic loss for the world as well. These rock shelters fostered our understanding the human beginnings of art, religion and culture, indeed the dawn of humanity's self-awareness – yet, as anthropologist Marcia Langton observed, \"their significance for further understanding of deep human history is a matter that was willfully ignored by Rio Tinto.\" What consequences did Rio Tinto suffer for its recklessness? Several of its executives will lose their bonuses, totaling roughly $6.7 million (USD 4.9 million) – a mere slap on the wrist which in the absence of legislation will do nothing to protect the few similar sites that remain.</p><p>Dr Lawrence Owens, an archaeologist and anthropologist from the University of London, told Mining Technology, \"There is no other way of putting this – the destruction of Juukan Gorge cave was a travesty and a disgrace.\" He added, \"It is difficult to fully express the magnitude of what this site was, what it meant, and how its destruction has impacted upon us all.\" The caves that Rio Tinto blasted have been understandably compared to Stonehenge which is some 5,000 years old – yet the comparison does not really do justice to what we lost, given that this site was nearly ten times older than that. Moreover, unlike Stonehenge which belongs entirely to a bygone era, these caves have been continually occupied by the same peoples, generation after generation, over these tens of thousands of years. They were a kind of \"encyclopedia of the Aboriginal people.\"</p><p>One of the most precious and astounding discoveries in the cave was a 4,000-year-old length of plaited human hair, woven together from strands from the heads of several different people. This remarkable find established through DNA testing a direct link to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura traditional owners living today.</p><p>Rio Tinto received permission to conduct the blasts in 2013 under Section 18 of the WA Aboriginal Heritage Act. It is an offence under Section 17 of the Aboriginal Heritage Act (AHA) of 1972 to excavate, destroy, damage, conceal or in any way alter an Aboriginal site. However, under Section 18 landowners may apply for consent to breach the restrictions established under Section 17. Accordingly, Rio Tinto was not operating illegally or flouting the law.</p><p>David Ritter, former principal legal officer for the Yamatji Land and Sea Council, observed that, \"It is a myth, expressed by the objects of the Aboriginal Heritage Act that the main purpose of the legislation is to protect Aboriginal heritage. It may be more accurate to describe the AHA as an act to regularize the obliteration of Aboriginal heritage... It is legislation by the non-Indigenous community for the non-Indigenous community that creates a superficial veneer of protection for Indigenous interests. The result is that the colonizing power can continue to do with Aboriginal places and materials exactly as it wants.\"</p><p>We know that this desecration could have been avoided altogether because during a federal parliamentary inquiry, Rio Tinto's CEO, Jean-Sebastien Jacques stated that there were four options to expand the iron ore mine in the area. Three of the options would have avoided the rock shelters, but the mining company chose the more destructive alternative as it allowed them to extract $135 million (USD 97 million) worth of iron ore, a profit that exceeded the other choices. They opted for the route that allowed the company to mine \"8 million tonnes of higher-grade iron ore,\" according to Mr. Jacques.</p><p>It has long been recognized that Australian laws do not adequately protect Aboriginal heritage sites. The Dampier Archipelago of Western Australia is home to thousands of Aboriginal pictographs, and perhaps the oldest surviving rock art in the world. Indeed, Australia's Indigenous art represents the longest uninterrupted tradition of art in the world – going back over 50,000 years – with examples having been found that depict long-extinct megafauna; including the Thyalacine (Tasmanian tiger) and Fat-tailed Kangaroo. Representations of the now-extinct marsupial lion have also been found in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.</p><p>The extraordinary rock art of the Dampier Archipelago easily constitutes the largest and most diverse gallery of petroglyphs in the world. Recent archeological research confirms that the Dampier Archipelago and Burrup Peninsula (formerly known as Dampier Island) contains the largest concentration of ancient rock art in the world. However, the rock art of the Burrup Peninsula has been physically destroyed by construction and eroded by industrial emissions, continually \"under threat due to high concentrations of acidic and nitrate-rich pollution from nearby industrial complexes,\" according to a 2017 report published by the Journal of Archeological Science.</p><p>What we know is that the cultural and scientific significance of the rock art is comparable to 'such world-renowned prehistoric art galleries as the caves of Lascaux in the Dordogne, and Altamira in northern Spain'. The tragedy is that we are losing the cultural riches of these region before we have had a chance to truly understand their significance – for, as a 2006 report prepared for the National Trust of Australia (WA) states, \"numerous petroglyphs and other archaeological features have been destroyed and a significant portion of the extraordinary heritage of the Dampier Archipelago has been irretrievably compromised without any clear understanding of what has been lost.\"</p><p>Aboriginal people represent the oldest continuous culture in the world – adequate protection of that culture will be encouraged when we respect and appreciate the wisdom of the Aboriginal people and their genius for 'living with and fostering their environment.' We may, for example, view Aboriginal rock art as disrupting the dualistic, Cartesian view of landscape, offering instead an embodied approach which recognizes that we \"do not live in an environment. Such a position immediately posits our separation. Rather we have an environment and we are part of it and it is part of us… We are… immersed.\" In Animism: Respecting the Living World (2005), Graham Harvey observes that, \"[W]e have far too many experiences of the aliveness of the world and the importance of a diversity of life to fall in step completely with Cartesian modernity.\" We need to broaden the interpretative lens with which we view Aboriginal rock art and see that in fact it represents an important challenge, and possibly a corrective to an overly dualistic ontology, which pits nature versus culture, mind versus body and human versus non-human.</p>",

    "subHeading": "",
    "description": "<p><strong>New York (The Hawk):</strong>&nbsp;Recently I had an opportunity to brief a group of European diplomats and journalists on a variety of conflicts, with a focus on the Middle East. During the Q&amp;A I was asked which of the region's conflicts Biden should tackle first. Without much hesitation I said the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, not only because it is over seven decades old, but because it is an increasingly intractable, explosive, and destabilizing situation, which reverberates throughout the Mideast, and several regional powers are exploiting it to serve their own national interests, which sadly contributes to its endurance.</p><p>It is expected that Biden will support a two-state solution given his past position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, albeit a growing number of Israelis and Palestinians no longer believe that such an outcome remains viable. I disagree with this belief: the Palestinians will never give up their right to establish an independent state of their own, and the one-state solution, which is being floated as an alternative, will never be accepted by the Israelis, because that would compromise the Jewish national identity of the state and undercut its democratic nature.</p><p>Due to the interdispersement of the Israeli and Palestinian populations, the two independent states, however, will have to fully collaborate in many areas, especially on security and economic development. This will lead to the establishment of the framework for a confederation, which will be the final outcome after several years of peace and reconciliation.</p><p>For Biden to succeed where his predecessors failed, he must repair the severe damage that Trump has inflicted on the entire peace process and restore the Palestinians' confidence in a new negotiation that could, in fact, lead to a permanent solution. To that end, he must take specific measures before the start of the talks and establish rules of engagements to which both sides must fully subscribe to demonstrate their commitment to reaching an agreement.</p><p>Preliminary Measures</p><p>Reestablish the PLO mission in DC: Biden should allow the Palestinian Authority (PA) to reestablish its mission in DC. This would immediately open a channel of communication which is central to the development of a dialogue between the US and the PA and to clear some of the initial hurdles before resuming the negotiations.</p><p>Resuming financial aid: It is essential that Biden restore the financial aid that the Palestinians had been receiving from the US. The Palestinian Authority is financially strapped and is in desperate need of assistance. The aid given should be monitored to ensure that the money is spent on specific program and projects.</p><p>Prohibiting territorial annexation: The Biden administration should inform the Israeli government that it will object to any further annexation of Palestinian territories. It will, however, keep the American embassy in Jerusalem and continue recognizing Jerusalem as its capital, leaving its final status to be negotiated.</p><p>Freezing settlement expansion: Given the intense controversy about the settlements and their adverse psychological and practical effect on the Palestinians, Biden should insist that Israel impose a temporary freeze on the expansion of settlements. This issue should top the negotiating agenda to allow for a later expansion of specific settlements in the context of land swaps.</p><p>Invite Hamas to participate: The Biden administration should invite Hamas to participate in the negotiations jointly with the PA or separately, provided they renounce violence and recognize Israel's right to exist. If they refuse, they should be left to their own devices and continue to bear the burden of the blockade.</p><p>Appoint professional and unbiased mediators: Unlike Trump's envoys who openly supported the settlements and paid little or no heed to the Palestinians' aspirations, Biden's envoys should be known for their integrity, professionalism, and understanding of the intricacies of the conflict, and be committed to a two-state solution.</p><p>Invite Arab and European observers: The Arab states and the EU are extremely vested in a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Saudi and German officials will be ideal observers who can render significant help in their unique capacity as leading Arab and European powers.</p><p>Rules of engagement</p><p>Establishing the end game: No negotiations succeed unless the parties involved agree on the nature of their desired outcome. For the Palestinians it is establishing an independent Palestinian state, and for Israelis it is maintaining the security and independence of a democratic Jewish state. Before embarking on new negotiations, the Biden administration should insist that both sides unequivocally commit to a two-state outcome.</p><p>Acknowledging historical and psychological impediments: Both sides have paid little heed in the past to the need to understand each other's historic experiences—the Holocaust for the Israelis and the Nakba (catastrophe) for the Palestinians—which they subconsciously use as protective shields. Acknowledging each other's respective traumatic experiences would help mitigate the psychological impediments which continue to feed into the mutual distrust and hatred.</p><p>Ending public acrimony: No negotiations can be conducted in good faith in an atmosphere of mutual public acrimony, as had been the case in all prior peace talks. An integral part of any negotiating process is to build trust, which cannot be nurtured while denouncing each other publicly. Leaders on both sides must end acrimonious statements, as their respective publics will have no faith in negotiations under such an atmosphere.</p><p>Renouncing and preventing violence: Both sides must commit not only to renouncing violence but to doing everything in their power to prevent acts of violence against one another. To be sure, nothing is more disruptive to the negotiations than a wanton act of violence. To that end, both sides need to fully collaborate on all security matters and send a clear massage, especially to extremists on both sides, that violence will not be tolerated and perpetrators will suffer severe consequences.</p><p>Delinking and \"banking\" agreed-upon issues: What will be necessary in future talks is to commit to \"bank\" any agreement reached on a specific issue, delink it from all others, and not subject it to renegotiations should the talks stall or collapse. This would prevent the resumption of negotiations from ground zero and allow for the building blocks that could eventually lead to an agreement.</p><p>In that regard, five critical issues—the settlements, Jerusalem, the Palestinian refugees, national security, and borders—have been hashed and rehashed ad nauseum in past negotiations. The Biden team should identify any common denominator on these issues to prevent renegotiating certain elements over which both sides have already agreed.</p><p>Establishing a process of reconciliation: The negotiating process must simultaneously be accompanied by a process of reconciliation. Both sides must initiate widespread people-to-people interactions to gradually mitigate the deep animosity and distrust between them which cannot simply be negotiated away. Israelis and Palestinians should engage in many activities, including sports, performing arts, tourism, development projects, and student interactions, to foster trust and confidence that peaceful coexistence is possible.</p><p>Keeping the public informed: Given that both sides will be required to make significant concessions, it will be imperative to keep their respective publics informed about the progress being made in the negotiations to engender support. Keeping the public in the dark, as was the practice in past, prevented the public from developing any vested interest in the negotiating process and its successful outcome.</p><p>The failure of both sides to agree in the past to establish and be governed by the above rules of engagement clearly suggests that neither side negotiated in good faith. The Biden administration must insist that Israelis and Palestinians accept the above rules if they want to resume the negotiations in earnest. Otherwise, the new talks will be nothing but an exercise in futility.</p><p>Sadly though, the current leaders in Israel and Palestine are not in a position to enter into serious negotiations, and must leave the political scene before Biden resumes new talks. Prime Minister Netanyahu is on record opposing the establishment of a Palestinian state; he is also facing three criminal charges of corruption, and in spite of his impressive accomplishments, he may well have outlived his usefulness.</p><p>President Abbas too has taken a hard position in connection with the settlements, Jerusalem, and the refugees, and it will be nearly impossible for him to make any significant concession and survive politically. He is also \"too comfortable\" in his position and does not want to leave the political scene accused of having sold the Palestinian cause. In the interim, Biden should reiterate the US commitment to Israel's national security and his support for the establishment of a Palestinian state, giving a clear signal that only moderation will win the day.</p><p>The US remains the indispensable power that can bring both sides to an enduring peace, because no other power can exert the kind of influence needed to reach a breakthrough. For the Biden administration to bring this about, it must play an active role by advancing its own ideas and put its foot down when necessary because neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians can have it only their way, and certainly not without direct US involvement.</p><p>As president, Biden has a momentous opportunity to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and both sides will do well to grasp the moment.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>New York (The Hawk):</strong>&nbsp;While I cheer Biden's victory in the presidential election, I lament the state of the union Trump is leaving behind. Sadly, Biden's victory has not been a repudiation of Trump, as he received more votes than any Republican candidate before him, which shocked millions of Americans. Why? Trump is a creature of our own making. He may be seen as an aberration, but he is not. Unless we pay more attention to the tens of millions who voted for him, among many other despairing Americans, and address their grievances and frustration, a hypocrite just like Trump will rise and feed on the public discontent—another rebel in Trump's image who appeals to the masses sickened by being ignored, another demagogue who personifies Trump and thrives on hatred, division, and contempt.</p><p>Our democracy is broken, as faith in our constitutional system and culture that guided us has been all but shattered. If we continue to ignore this reality, a very ominous future will await this nation. We are witnessing the rise of bald-faced authoritarianism and if an increasing number of Americans cease to embrace our revered democratic norms, our Republic as we know it will cease to exist. It will be replaced by an authoritarian regime that will rise by a popular vote and gradually stamp out our democracy and revoke the will of the people.</p><p>The betrayal of the Republican party</p><p>The danger to our democracy comes chiefly from the Republican Party. Trump is the product of the Republicans' fantasy that only they should rule, which is befitting a party that has long since lost its moral compass. The Republicans are terrified of losing their ability to rule because of the steadily-increasing diversity of America, the continuing evolution into a minority-majority country, the expansion of liberalism throughout the country, the growing disenchantment of women with their policies, and the disillusionment of the youth with the stubbornly growing extreme Republican conservatism.</p><p>The Republicans did not shy away from resorting to any sinister scheme to hold onto the levers of power. They have aggressively pursued voter suppression, fought tooth and nail to keep gerrymandering in place, viciously clung to the Electoral College, stacked the courts with conservative judges, and catered to white supremacists. But when all has failed to change the outcome of the fairest and freest elections, they follow their self-possessed leader claiming that the election was fraudulent, stolen, and rigged.</p><p>They refuse to validate the result of the election, knowing full well that nothing is more injurious to democracy than defying the will of the majority and preventing the peaceful transfer of power. The majority of top Republican officials still refuse to acknowledge Biden's victory, delaying the transition (which prevents Biden from accessing vital information, especially in connection with the pandemic) while thousands continue to die; every single death during this delay is on their hands.</p><p>This is the party whose leaders bask in conspiracy theories. To them facts do not matter; they believe in magic and miracles while disparaging scientific truths, belittling political opponents to cover for their innate political hypocrisy. Worst yet, they have surrendered to a would-be dictator who has his claws around their neck and is determined to dismantle the fundamentals of our democracy, and who has brought the nation to the precipice of disaster.</p><p>Restoring the values of our democracy</p><p>If nothing else, the election has proven that America is in desperate need of an expansive re-education in civility and responsible citizenry to instill and cement the values that have sustained it in the past. We need to reform the electoral systems and legislative processes. We must prevent political polarization and mismanagement of our constitutional democracy on which demagogues like Trump can thrive, and restore our global leadership role.</p><p>Regardless of how misguided Trump followers' belief in him may be, they and millions of other Americans do have legitimate concerns and needs that must be addressed. Biden is facing monumental tasks, starting by tackling the coronavirus (as economic recovery is closely tied to controlling the epidemic). Our democracy, however, will remain vulnerable to the same morally debased elements of Republican politics that nearly tore our democracy apart.</p><p>If we are to survive the onslaught of disinformation, demagoguery, falsehood, inequality and treachery that Trump perpetrates, which is cheered by his Republican sheep, we must shut tightly the cave in which demagogues like Trump hide. We must diligently undertake the needed socio-political and economic reforms to prevent an imposter like Trump from returning in four years and ravaging once again our democratic way of life, plunging us anew into ominous social and political strife.</p><p>Biden's victory provides us with a small window of opportunity to repair some of the damage that Trump and the Republican party have inflicted on our democracy. Indeed, democracy can be the breeding ground that allows of demagogues like Trump to rise. To save our democracy and prevent that from happening and deny the Republicans minority rule again, we must develop an inclusive social and economic agenda to meet the needs of the people.</p><p>Repairing America's socio-economic erosion</p><p>Democracy cannot be sustained when the gap between the rich and poor grows ever wider, when thousands of small towns and villages are crumbling, especially in rural areas, when more than 12 million children go to sleep hungry and when a half a million people are homeless roaming the streets.</p><p>Democracy rings hollow when tens of millions of citizens live in abject poverty and have no healthcare, when Blacks and Latinos are the victims of discrimination and inequality, when schools are decaying and teachers are underpaid, when dropouts from school are multiplying and jobs are scarce, and when two and a half million people are languishing in jails and prisons, the majority for non-violent offenses.</p><p>Democracy fails when drug addicts are incarcerated instead of being treated and healed, when 40,000 American are killed by firearms every year, when the judiciary is becoming increasingly biased, when climate change is wreaking havoc on the country from coast to coast and people are displaced, when police brutality is commonplace.</p><p>Over the past four years in particular, the Republicans wrote one of the darkest chapters in American history. History books will recall how their moral bankruptcy allowed them to sacrifice the well-being of the nation and betray the most principled experiment in democracy in human history. Their defeat in this presidential election may well be the harbinger for worse days yet to come.</p><p>As for me, I still have strong faith in the American enterprise. We have fought civil and world wars, faced depressions, corrupt administrations, social unrest, and costly foreign misadventures, but then, we have emerged stronger and an inspiration to other nations.</p><p>As long as we remain committed to the democratic values that we have cherished and for which we have sacrificed so much, a brighter and better future will await us.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>New York (The Hawk):&nbsp;</strong>On Wednesday Trump yet again refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power following the election: \"Well, we're going to have to see what happens. You know that I've been complaining very strongly about the ballots and the ballots are a disaster.\" Trump has demonstrated beyond any doubt that he has no respect for American democracy as such. His words should be seen as an assault on the very foundations of this country, which is first and foremost a nation that has always ensured and honored the smooth succession of executive authority. What the president said is nothing short of treasonous, and may well lead to open violence should he lose — a situation for which he is apparently prepared and fomenting his base. Trump has said and done much that was harmful during his time in office, but this statement may be the very worst and most dangerous things that has ever come out of his mouth.</p><p>Early Thursday morning Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rebuked Trump's statement in a tweet affirming that there will be a peaceful transition of power. That same evening, a resolution introduced by Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) passed unanimously, which affirms \"the Senate's commitment to the orderly and peaceful transfer of power called for in the Constitution of the United States,\" noting that a \"disruption\" in the transfer of executive power \"could produce results detrimental to the safety and well-being of the United States.\" However, such a resolution is largely figurative and may lack statuary power if Trump still refuses to recognize the result of the election.</p><p>Although the resolution sent a clear message that he is crossing a red line that even his supporters in the Senate will not accept, it is critical that every political body, institution, think tank, and media outlet that stands for democracy comes out immediately with a clear, decisive, and unambiguous statement condemning Trump's assertion to send him a message that what he said is tantamount to treason and that he will face the direst consequences.</p><p>In fact, even during the presidential debates in 2016, Trump repeatedly stated that he would not accept the results of the election unless he won. There should be no reason at this point, now that he is president, not to take him at his word. The media in general should hammer this point day in and day out now until the transfer of power on January 20, 2021.</p><p>The House of Representatives must follow the Senate's lead and pass immediately a resolution, warning Trump of the ominous consequences he and the country will face if he does not adhere to the constitutional process and vacate his office peacefully. Beyond Congress, every Republican in any official capacity must immediately issue a statement condemning in the strongest terms Trump's clear refusal to commit to a peaceful transition of power should he lose in November. Such a statement must be unmistakable, and leave no room for any doubt.</p><p>Opinion writers who value the importance of a peaceful transition of power and the critical importance of free and fair elections and the adherence to their results should immediately write a column, whether for their media outlet or at a minimum on social media, condemning in the strongest words what Trump has said.</p><p>Vice President Biden should raise Trump's refusal to commit to a peaceful transfer of power during next week's debate. Biden must demand a clear and explicit commitment from Trump in front of the nearly 100 million Americans who will be watching that he will adhere to a peaceful transition of power and will not contest the results.</p><p>Gen. Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, should reiterate his statements from July and August that the military will not intervene under any circumstances in a political matter, whether protecting Trump from being removed from the White House should he lose and refuse to leave, or physically removing him in the same situation. For good reason, Trump's physical removal from the White House should be left to US Marshals.Every civil society organization ought to issue a warning that the American people will not stand for anything less than a peaceful transfer of power, and that they will promote nation-wide civil disobedience in the absence of such transition. In conjunction, many labor unions, such as the AFL-CIO, UAW, and American Federation of Teachers, should issue a similar statement that a nation-wide strike will occur.</p><p>Constitutional experts from all over the country should sign a joint letter to state that refusing a peaceful transfer of power is clearly in contrast to what the Constitution is all about, and condemn Trump's words in the strongest terms.</p><p>Although he has already pledged to push through a hearing, if Mitch McConnell has an ounce of integrity left, he should now refuse to initiate a confirmation hearing of any Supreme Court nominee, which Trump vowed to submit within days. Trump, who has gone on a rampage to delegitimize the result of the election for months, made it clear that should he lose the Supreme Court will have to adjudicate and render the final decision.</p><p>This is why he is rushing to nominate another Republican Supreme Court Justice, hoping that he or she will vote in his favor. The Democrats should hammer home and remind McConnell of his actions in 2016, when he refused to even meet with Obama's nominee Merrick Garland, let alone hold confirmation hearings. To continue with Trump's plan will only demonstrate McConnell's hypocrisy, which may destroy the Republican Party in the process.</p><p>Four years of political turmoil under Trump may well end with massive violence akin to a civil war. Trump is priming his base to act violently, and with over 390 million firearms in the hands of Americans, one can only imagine the calamitous consequences if violence is to erupt between his supporters and those who oppose him.</p><p>The Republican leadership in every state and every municipality are the prime body that can stop this potential calamity from occurring. Time is of the essence. Should the Republican Party as a whole fall short of taking a stand against Trump at this juncture, they will subject the nation to turmoil unseen since the Civil War. Not a single Republican leader will be able to claim that he or she were not warned.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Studying in the mother tongue will help to replace the rote method of learning and examination-based learning with a home system based on conceptual understanding. The aim is to improve the student's cognitive skills in their language so that they are not burdened by other languages. We can suppress and complete our primary education with fervor. On this Hindi day, we should promote it vigorously so that parents do not push their children unnecessarily to send them to the only English Medium.</strong></p><p>The Union Cabinet recently approved the new National Education Policy 2020 to bring \"large-scale transformational reforms\" in both school and higher education. The new education policy for the country came after about 34 years. It has brought something new to the existing education system. In the new National Education Policy 2020, it is decided to make home language, mother tongue, or regional language as the medium of education up to class 5. Experts believe that it can create long term effects in nation-building. Providing school education in the mother tongue or regional language can bring a drastic change in the ongoing process of human resource development.</p><p>Analysts believe that regional languages help to increase human values and feelings and that learning the mother tongue will help future generations make connections with their social and cultural fabric. Early schooling in a child's mother tongue, as recommended in the new National Education Policy, can improve learning, increase student participation, and reduce worldwide burdens. However, this will require new books, new teacher training, and more funding, moreover, given the plurality of languages and dialects in India, it can be used as a medium of instruction in an area to which other It is difficult to work in languages.</p><p>The National Education Policy (NEP) states that the medium of instruction in schools up to grade V should be a mother tongue or local or regional language wherever possible, up to eighth grade. \"All efforts will be made to ensure that there are no gaps between the language spoken by the child and the medium of teaching. In the early school years, the child's most comfortable use of the language will be its school attendance and learning outcomes. Improves. Studies around the world also find that it increases class participation, reduces the number of dropouts and grade repetitions.</p><p>It also provides an opportunity to familiarize themselves with social and cultural identity. Despite this, not all children in low and middle-income countries are taught in the language they speak. Today's parents prefer to send their children to 'English-medium' schools, regardless of the quality of education, believing that English language mastery ensures success in later life. For example, in 2017-18, about 14% of the people who enrolled in private schools in rural areas of India and 19.3% in urban areas chose a private school because there was a medium of English education.</p><p>Experts argue that English education is not always the best. Anyone can learn to read and write best in the language you know from day one. Good education occurs when children have high self-esteem, they are well adjusted in the classroom which provides a positive and fear-free environment. If the child is taught in a language that they do not understand, then nothing will happen.</p><p>In 2019, in rural India, only 16.2% of children enrolled in grade I can read grade I-level lessons, while only 39.5% can add single-digit numbers. The 2011 census listed 270 mother tongues; Of these, as per the 2017 study, 47 languages were used as a medium of instruction in Indian classrooms.</p><p>But we cannot even consider teaching in the mother tongue to solve the problem of low learning outcomes. For multilingual education to be successful there should be educational change and trained teachers who can deal with multiple languages in the classroom and teach in the child's mother tongue. The idea of using the mother tongue as a medium of instruction in primary school is not new to the Indian education system. Article 350A of the constitution states that every state and local authority should strive to provide \"adequate facilities for education in the mother tongue at the primary stage of education to children belonging to linguistic minority groups\".</p><p>The Kothari Commission Report on Education and National Development (1964–66) suggested that in tribal areas, for the first two years of school, the medium of instruction and books should be in the local tribal language. The regional language should be taught separately and should become the medium of instruction by the third year. The Right to Education Act, 2009 also stated that as far as possible, the medium of instruction in school should be the mother tongue of the child.</p><p>There are many languages in India, with 270 mother tongues identified in the 2011 census and classrooms may contain children with more than one spoken language. It may not be possible for all languages to become the medium of instruction and it may not be possible to implement it in large parts of the country.The initial investment in bilingual programs may be higher because of the additional cost of developing new learning materials, especially for languages that are not standardized or that do not have scripts. This will require trained teachers to teach in a multilingual classroom and new teachers fluent in these languages. Since education is a concurrent subject, most states have their school boards. Therefore, state governments have to come forward for the actual implementation of this decision.</p><p>The new National Education Policy 2020 aims at holistic development in the educational and co-educational domains of every student and emphasizes educating students, teachers, and parents to nurture their potential to serve the nation. In some schools across the country for about three-four years, trying out the new model, identifying the problems encountered in implementation and the cost of change, and then preparing an action plan to solve these problems.This will prove to be extremely beneficial in removing hierarchies and barriers between different knowledge streams by providing easy and accessible methods.</p><p>Studying in the mother tongue will help replace the rote method of learning and examination-based learning with a home system based on conceptual understanding. The purpose of which is to improve the student's cognitive skills in his language, so that he cannot be burdened with other languages and complete his primary education with fervor. On this Hindi day, we should promote this thing vigorously so that parents do not push their children to send them to the English Medium without undue pressure. We have to break the notion that today's parents prefer to send their children to 'English-medium' schools, regardless of the quality of education, assuming that English language mastery ensures success in later life.—The Hawk Features</p>",

    "postText": "Serbia-Kosovo Agreement Falls Far Short Of Ending Their Conflict\n",
    "subHeading": "",
    "description": "<p><strong>New York (The Hawk):&nbsp;</strong>The recent agreement between Kosovo and Serbia, brokered by the US, to normalize economic relations between the two countries fell short of the needed reconciliation process that would lead to full recognition of Kosovo's independence by Serbia. Some elements of the economic normalization agreement are positive, including operationalizing the peace highway and the rail link between Pristina and Merdare, sharing Gazivode/Ujmani Lake and exploring its use as a reliable water and energy supply, and receiving financial support from the US International Development Finance Corporation and Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) for the above. These and other projects will create job opportunities for several thousand Kosovars and alleviate some of the economic hardship in the country.</p><p>Sadly, the agreement will prove to be superficial not only because it does not require Serbia to recognize Kosovo at one point in the future, but it does not even commit Serbia to renounce, once and for all, its illegitimate de-recognition campaign against Kosovo. The fact that Serbia agreed to \"refrain from formally or informally requesting any nation or International Organization not to recognize Kosovo [Pristina] as an independent state\" amounts to no more than lip service. Belgrade knows that Russia will veto any UNSC resolution to recognize Kosovo, which is the most important international body.</p><p>What is also disturbing is that there are a number of side-shows in the agreement designed to boost Trump's standing in his struggle for reelection that have little or nothing to do with the Serbia-Kosovo conflict. This includes mutual Israeli-Kosovo recognition, which requires Pristina to open its embassy in Jerusalem, to which the EU sternly opposes, and agreeing to designate Hezbollah as terrorist organization. Furthermore, apart from these sidebars, there isn't anything in the agreement that wasn't already in the works or fully agreed to prior to US involvement. Finally, the agreement is not a treaty; either country can walk away from it without any penalty.</p><p>Customarily, Trump is fixated on economic development as if it were a panacea that can resolve all conflicts, irrespective of history, the psychological dimension (which continues to haunt Kosovo in particular), and the prevailing adversarial political environment they have been living with and continue to embrace. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict offers one example. At an economic summit in Bahrain, it was agreed that the Palestinians would be provided with a massive economic package as a part of the process to lead to peace; however, it fell flat on its face as it ignored past and current economic relations between the two sides, and did nothing to resolve their conflict.</p><p>The conflict between Serbia and Kosovo is deeply imbedded in their psyche, and as long as historic reconciliation is absent, no amount of economic normalization will mitigate deep-seeded distrust and their fundamental demands. To end the conflict there indeed must be a process of reconciliation, and economic normalization is only one of several prerequisites for such a process to succeed.</p><p>The process of reconciliation, however, must be anchored on Serbia's permanent renunciation of its de-recognition campaign against Kosovo. To simply suspend such a campaign for a year, as stipulated in the agreement, demonstrates Serbia's lack of commitment to recognize Kosovo now or at any time in the future.</p><p>Kosovo's Prime Minister Hoti made a terrible mistake by not making this requirement a prerequisite to any agreement with Serbia. Indeed, what is the point of developing economic relations when Serbia can after one year resume its de-recognition campaign? Hoti's failure to insist that on this requirement makes a mockery of the whole agreement, which benefits Serbia economically without requiring it to make the commitment (central to reconciliation and building trust) to end its sinister campaign. Economic normalization should be treated only as a first step in a process of reconciliation, which must be based on the following to lead to mutual recognition:</p><p>First: People and goods should be allowed to move freely across the border in both directions to increase people-to-people interactions, which will gradually help heal wounds and nurture mutual trust. Serbians who have habitually looked down on Kosovar Albanians need to reorient themselves to the new realty. Equal treatment of their neighbors is central to reconciliation, especially because Serbia is larger, more affluent, and superior to Kosovo militarily. Kosovo cannot negotiate from a position of weakness and make any significant concessions without public outrage.</p><p>Second: A free trade agreement is vital not only to expand and improve relations from which both sides can greatly benefit, but to maximize efficiency and production of items uniquely designed for export to the other. Moreover, without tariffs on all imported goods, they would become more affordable and receive greater demand. The imposition of a 100 percent tariff on Serbian goods imported to Kosovo, which has since been lifted, offers an abject experience from which both countries should draw an instructive lesson.</p><p>Third: Serbia must admit to and accept responsibility for the war crimes it committed against Kosovo during the war in 1999. Without such an admission, no economic normalization or any other interaction on any socio-political levels can be sustained. Serbian atrocities and the horror Kosovar Albanians endured during the war will not fade away simply because of economic normalization. Serbia should borrow a page from Germany. Had Germany not admitted to the crimes against humanity it committed during World War II, it would have never been able to move past the horrifying, historic stain, let alone integrate into the European community and become one of the top leaders of the EU.</p><p>Fourth: EU observers must be involved in the process of \"locat[ing] and identify[ing] the remains of missing persons…and identifying and implementing long-term, durable solutions for refugees and internally displaced persons\" as stipulated by the agreement to ensure that this lingering and painful residue of the war is addressed, which is essential to reconciliation. Serbia has been reticent in this regard in the past, fearing that the uncovering of mass graves would provide further proof that it in fact committed war crimes on a large scale. Oversight is necessary to ensure the past is uncovered and wounds can begin to heal.</p><p>Fifth: Following this process, Serbia must commit to recognize Kosovo as an independent state within three to four years, during which many of the conflicting issues should be resolved through direct negotiations. When deadlocked, the EU would mediate any disagreement, especially because both countries want to integrate into the EU. Ending their conflict with the EU's input would help facilitate an agreement, which is a precondition to integration.</p><p>In the final analysis, Serbia must accept the irreversible reality of Kosovo as an independent state and that there is nothing it can do to change that reality. Over 110 countries have recognized Kosovo, including the US and a majority of EU member states. It is time for Belgrade to stop dreaming about Kosovo as if it still is or can be restored as one of its provinces.</p><p>Serbia, just like Kosovo however, knows well that its future security and prosperity lay with the EU. Entering into good-faith negotiations to settle their conflicts with the objective of reaching mutual recognition will open up a new horizon for both countries, where they can grow and flourish and give the new generation a hopeful future instead of remaining enslaved by the past.</p>",

The latter are veritably clueless seriously wondering how to plough in $ 5 Tn and from where. Deadline for it is fast approaching near with the officers, each one of them fully tested and tried but now helpless, staring at each other with vacant looks finding no way out. They thus are deeply nervous, full of trepidation, and deeply apprehensive of what answers they will deliver when they will be summoned to present their report/s on $ 5 Tn Economy that will be India.</p><p>On the other hand, Finance-related Nucleus in the PMO is closely working with the Prime Minister Modi himself to give practical shape to his $ 5 Tn Economy that will be India very soon : The pragmatic strategy is : Sell off all infructuous PSUs, PSEs etc to Private Sector including Foreign Parties and plough in $ 5 Tn at the earliest and in fact, according to modest calculations, very many much more than $ 5 Tn that may well give shape to a New India or Naya Bharat.</p><p>Truly speaking, in today's Globalised Economy, PSUs, PSEs related units really have no utility as international products in all sectors are uppermost unlike in Closed Economy era when PSUs, PSEs, related units were only exposure to buyers but surely so not today. Today, buyers of all hues have rejected anachronous, incongruous PSEs, PSUs, related units that if all are only burden to National Exchequer. Once rid from them, there will be unbelievably huge cash in National Exchequer far more than $ 5 Tn may be in double or even triple figures of Tn.</p><p>According to convinced sources in the High Government Circles, Prime Minister Modi personally is ensuring that every bit of the PSE, PSU etc are accounted for in National Exchequer-benefitting and no loss of a single pie. He is aware that he is being presently criticised for selling off the PSEs etc but once the countrymen see the utility of that in terms of all round developments of the country in all its sectors and in all their levels, all controversies will instantly end.</p><p>To say the least on this matter, even while the Vitta Mantralaya officers may be nervous (argument against them is, they should have been so long ago when due to their Vitta Policies and their implementations, countless countrymen suffered forced pebury, parsimony but they were never so rather they enjoyed unaccounted parvenu status apart from their official cash slips et al), Pradhan Mantri himself is enervating, self-abnegating day in-day out to facilitate India face --- no seemingly impossible --- $ 5 Tn Economy and may be more! —The Hawk Features</p>",

The basic objective of all guidelines remain an early detection of case for quick isolation and care. In addition, testing remains a key strategy for the pandemic management on two counts – identification of new clusters and new hotspots of infection which can in turn facilitate immediate action for containment such as setting up containment zones, contact tracing and others and ensuring reduction in mortality and morbidity, the letter read. Delineating on ICMR testing advisory issued on January 10, Arti Ahuja, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Health, said in the letter, “All those who are symptomatic must be tested in community settings. All at risk contacts of laboratory confirmed cases must also be tested”.</p><p>“In order to ensure that an effective track of the spread of the pandemic is kept and also immediate citizen centric action is initiated, it is incumbent upon all states and UTs to enhance the testing”, the letter further said.</p><p>—IANS</p>",

Dheeraj got a chance to experiment with his look and he took up a turban-clad, Sardar avatar for the special episode.</p><p>During the two-year leap in the show viewers saw Karan (Dheeraj Dhoopar) and Preeta (Shraddha Arya) getting separated. Later, Prithvi (Sanjay Gagnani) has taken control of the Luthra Mansion and Preeta has returned to save the family. Now, in the latest track of 'Kundali Bhagya' there will be a party and Lohri celebrations.</p><p>Talking about his look Dheeraj said: \"Different roles demand different kinds of preparations; and I attempt to do it quite earnestly. For an actor, it's more of a physical preparation when it comes to a sequence like Lohri. I mean, culturally you know I belong to Delhi and a Punjabi family. Lohri is a very prominent festival in northern India. I have many good childhood memories associated with the festival. I always cherish meeting all the family members and dressing up in colourful traditional attire; dance and sing around the bonfire.\"</p><p>He further added: \"I have experimented with multiple looks with a countless number of costumes and dressing up as a Sardar feels special. There's always a plan of action as an actor and it's my job to give my 101 per cent to every character, be it any look. I am always excited for new challenges and this fresh avatar was a welcome change. The fun part of acting is you get to play a completely different person each time.\"</p>",

The video platform Bilibili, where the man was employed as a content auditor, said company representatives went to the hospital to assist and then notified his family.</p><p>Bilibili released an internal memo rejecting claims the employee -- who reportedly died of a brain haemorrhage -- was overworked. It said the man had worked from 9.30 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. for the past week, with no overtime, the report said.</p><p>But reports of his death by a workplace blogger on Monday renewed heated discussion about a toxic overtime culture dubbed '996' -- referring to an expectation that employees, especially in the tech industry, work from 9am to 9pm six days a week. The expectation has in the past been promoted by high-profile figures including the Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, The Guardian reported.</p><p>A hashtag related to the man's death and including the allegation of overwork trended on Weibo, receiving hundreds of millions of views, including accusations the government had not done enough to address the problems in the year since a spate of high profile deaths linked to overwork in 2020.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Kanpur (The Hawk):&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while addressing the huge election rally here in Shahbajpur village of Kanpur dehat on Monday said, “The 'Parivaarwadi' will again be defeated by the people of Uttar Pradesh. The festival of colours - Holi will be celebrated in Uttar Pradesh on 10th March itself.” Targeting the opposition, he asked, “When they keep changing their allies, then how will they serve the people of Uttar Pradesh? Earlier governments looted the people of the state. People of UP have defeated them in 2014, then in 2017 and 2019, and now in 2022 again these staunch ‘Parivarwadis’ will lose.” PM Modi further alleged, “Before 2017, when there were governments of these extreme 'Parivarwadis', then everyday there were reports of ration scams from UP. These people had created lakhs of fake ration cards. But our Double Engine Sarkar has stopped this game of fake ration cards. Today, crores of the UP public are receiving ration free of cost. Stoves of my poor sisters and mothers will never be turned off. We have to walk on the path of development. Welfare and upliftment of the poor is BJP's main priority\". \"If they had their way, they would have made Kanpur and other such areas in UP, a 'mafiaganj' mohalla. Now their 'mafiagiri' is counting its last breath. These 'Parivarwadi' want to give power to the mafias again,” he added.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Earlier, the Prime Minister expressed his gratitude towards the people for their support and said, “Voting is going on in the second phase in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Goa today. I would urge all the voters, especially the first-time voters, to come out to vote in maximum numbers.”</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Mounting a blistering attack on the TMC, PM Modi reiterated, “In an interview to a news publication in Goa, a TMC leader said that they have formed alliance with a particular party to divide Hindu votes in Goa. I want to tell Goa voters that is the chance to bury such kind of politics.”</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">“The trend of the second phase in UP and the voting in the first phase has made four things very clear – First, ‘BJP Ki Sarkar, Yogi Ji Ki Sarkar Phir Se Aa Rahi Hai’. Second, People of every caste, people of every class are voting without division, people in villages and cities are voting without division, they are unitedly voting for fast development of UP. Third, our mothers, sisters and daughters have taken responsibility to ensure BJP’s win. Fourth, Muslim sisters, quietly, without making any noise, are coming out of their homes to bless Modi because they know who has worked for their welfare,” he added.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Elaborating on the benefits of Double Engine Sarkar, PM Modi asserted, “34 lakh houses have been given to the poor under the PM-Awas Yojana in the state. Out of this, 13 lakh Dalits have got the houses. Also, the Muslim girls feel safe under the BJP rule in Uttar Pradesh. Many Muslim girls are going to schools and colleges in the state now.” The PM recounted several measures for welfare of farmers in the state. He mentioned how PM-KISAN, Kisan Credit Cards have benefitted the farmers immensely. He also spoke how double engine government is promoting biofuel usage, which in turn, is helping the sugarcane farmers of Uttar Pradesh.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">PM Modi urged voters in Uttar Pradesh to vote for the BJP in the upcoming assembly elections. He said, “Pehle Matdan, Kamal Nishan Aur Phir Koi Anya Kaam”. Several BJP leaders and karyakartas were present in the event.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Earlier, the chief minister Yogi Aditya Nath welcomed the prime minister on the dias. Speaking on the occasion, Yogi said the Modi government had saved the countrymen by giving them the vaccine to combat Covid-19 pandemic. Hence, people involved in propaganda about the vaccine should be given a befitting reply with \"jo bachayega voh saccha saathi hai, jo gumrah karega voh avsarvadi hai\" (who will save is the real friend, who will beguile is the opportunist). He said earlier people would die of hunger but now during the Double Engine Sarkar, they were getting the double ration.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Meanwhile, party workers in Kanpur also attended the prime minister's rally through virtual mode. District unit president Sunil Bajaj said people in 14 Mandals of North district saw the rally on big screen.

The event has already assumed huge political significance for its Dalit powerhouse image in poll-bound Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Celebrations begin on Monday at Seer Gowardhanpur, where the mystic saint was born, with the arrival of Trust chairman Sant Niranjandas from Begumpura in a special train.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The area wears a festive look with pilgrims trickling in from across the country. The devotees will stay in a tent city that has come up near the Ravidas temple. Two special trains with hundreds of pilgrims from Punjab are scheduled to arrive on Monday and Tuesday, before the main celebrations on Wednesday.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Trust member, Kishanlal Saroa, and temple manager Ranvir Singh said, \"The Trust has sent invites to top politicians but the 'darbar' of Sant Ravidas is open for all. Anyone can take part in the birth anniversary celebrations. With model code of conduct in force, no politician, however, would be allowed to speak from the dais though they will be free to offer prayers and seek blessings.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">District Magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma, however, denied receiving the itinerary of any big politician so far.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">He said, \"All necessary arrangements for conducting Ravidas Jayanti celebrations, including accommodation of pilgrims as per Covid-19 protocol has been completed by the trust. Roads leading to the shrine have been repaired and the area revamped with improved sanitation and lighting. —IANS</span></p>",

For this, it was necessary to alert people against it saying that 'be alert - the security, respect that you are getting, people have come to disrupt that and do not let that happen'. It was my responsibility to alert people.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Highlighting the incidents of post-poll violence in West Bengal after Assembly elections in the state last year, Adityanath said, \"I want to ask, are elections held this peacefully in Bengal? Recently, Bengal held Vidhan Sabah elections and BJP workers were tortured. Booths were captured. Anarchy was at its peak. Several people were killed. Similar was the case in Kerala. The violence, and political killings that have happened in these two states, where else has it happened?\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Drawing comparison of West Bengal elections with that of first phase of Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, he said that elections were held peacefully here.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"UP elections' first phase has been completed in a peaceful manner. Otherwise, riots took place here earlier. Anarchy was spread. Crime was at its peak,\" the Chief Minister said. \"In 5 years, did any riot take place?\" Adityanath asked when questioned about allegations on his government that minorities are not safe in Uttar Pradesh.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The Chief Minister said that his government works with an aim of providing security and prosperity to all and no appeasement to any particular community is done.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"In five years, were obstacles put in celebrating festivals? If festivals of the Hindus were celebrated with peace Muslims also celebrated festivals in a peaceful manner. When Hindus are peaceful, they (Muslims) are also peaceful. Hindus are safe so Muslims are also safe. We give security to all, prosperity to all, respect to all but no appeasement to any,\" he said.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">In a veiled attack at the previous government of the Samajwadi Party, Adityanath said such incidents of discrimination against minority communities is the \"greatest mockery of democracy.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"In a democracy, if any government disrespects the views of the public sentiments, distributes government scheme by looking at their faces, discriminates on caste, creed and religion -- this can be no greater mockery of democracy than this,\" the Cheif Minister said. Reiterating Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas', he said his government gives benefits with the vision, denying all allegations of the safety of minorities being compromised in the state.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Lauding the 'double-engine' government's efforts in vaccinating people against COVID-19, the Chief Minister highlighted that people of Uttar Pradesh express gratitude to the Prime Minister for saving their lives during the pandemic. \"Where ever I go, I ask people, 'did you take the vaccine?' People raise their hands and say yes. They express gratitude to the Prime Minister and say that lives have been saved because of him. Those who opposed and derided vaccine, people have countered them by taking vaccines and have expressed their support to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The UP chief minister further said, \"I can say that 15 crore people in UP, the double engine government is giving double dose ration to the people.\" \"Where was this money going before?\" he asked attacking SP chief Akhilesh Yadav.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Questioning the utilization of the state funds during his tenure in the state, Adityanath said that Akhilesh did not have time to think about these things adding that he was busy sleeping and dreaming. \"Akhilesh ji would not have these figures and he did not even want to keep them because he does not have the time. If he gets time from his friend circle, sleeping and dreaming, then only will he will think about these things. Therefore, he must not have this data. To have this information, he would have to employ a person before whom he would place these numbers and make him mug up. He is the son of a big figure. He sleeps 12 hours, spends 6 hours with his friend circle, and in the rest of the time, he would be busy with other work. Thus, he wouldn't know this information,\" Adityanath said.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Citing cases of the disproportionate asset against Akhilesh, Adityanath ruled out the involvement of BJP when asked about allegations on the party of misusing investigating agencies against Opposition during elections.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"There is a case against Akhlesh ji of disproportionate assets. Did this happen during the BJP government? In 2013, BJP was not in power at Centre or state. There are more cases against him. Was this because of BJP?\" he asked.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Pointing at income tax raids at SP MLC in December last year, Adityanath said all the money, which is now used in people's welfare was taken by Akhilesh's associates referring to them as \"ittar wale mitra\" (perfume traders) saying that these people took Uttar Pradesh's money abroad.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Denying any \"misuse\" of central agencies during election time, Adityanath said that raids by central agencies are a \"continuous process.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"Isn't it true that this money of the poor, meant for development was going to his 'ittar-wale mitra'. Now when ED has found out that his money was going to his 'ittar-wale mitra' and today when investigating agencies have made full-proof arrangements that 'ittar-wale mitra' were eating away the resources like termite when poor were dying of hunger and farmers were committing suicide. His friends in the perfume trade, after earning lump sum amounts, were settling the income earned in the UP, abroad. What is the work of the agencies? It is the agency's task to submit ill-gotten wealth to the state treasury and investigate it. It not only happened during the elections. It has been continuously happening and is a long task,\" Adityanath said.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The Chief Minister denied \"targetting\" Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and said that \"to drown Congress, no one else is needed.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"I went to Uttarakhand and had delivered a speech. Uttarakhand is a border state and it also borders UP. Uttarakhand is important in its own right. Ganga and Yamuna's water comes from Uttarakhand to enrich our fields and Army personnel stand at the border to protect the country. UP and Uttarakhand are joined together. Where are the differences between the two? But security is important. To drown Congress, no one else is needed. Brother and sister duo are there. Why do you want to make Congress a burden there; I only appealed to people,\" Adiyanath said.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Taking a dig at Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and SP, Adityanath said that they used corrupt practices and emptied state government treasuries.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Calling BSP chief Mayawati 'Bhenji', Adityanath said, \"Behnji has pointed fingers at my (Gorakhpur) 'Math'. I repeat myself, that the double dose ration that is being given to the poor used to be eaten away by mafias of the SP. Behnji's elephant (election symbol of the BSP) is so huge that things fall short for it.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The seven phased Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh commenced on February 10.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The second phase of polling for the state assembly is scheduled for February 14.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Altogether 55 assembly constituencies will go to the polls in the second phase covering nine districts of Saharanpur, Bijnor, Amroha, Sambhal, Moradabad, Rampur, Bareilly, Budaun and Shahjahanpur.&nbsp;—ANI</span></p>",

Elections have taken an 80 versus 20 direction. Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Congress are upset and are on the back foot after the first phase,\" he told ANI.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Reacting to SP chief Akhilesh Yadav's remarks of BJP cooling down after the first phase of elections, he said, \"The public's response has been cold towards Samajwadi Party in the first phase of the election. People bare warm towards the BJP and the party is going to the public with issues, our work is solid and our intentions are honest.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"I can say with confidence that the BJP will form the government in the state,\" he reiterated.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Adityanath countered the allegations of the opposition that the BJP does not have any real issues and said the party has issued its election manifesto and worked honestly on issues such as economic development and uplift of the poor.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Explaining what he means by the 80 versus 20 for the Uttar Pradesh elections, the chief minister said, \"80 per cent are those people who are happy with the state government's agenda of security, who appreciate the public welfare schemes of the state government. Those who like development. Those who got a chance to get their work (at government offices) done in an honest and transparent way.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Those people who have experienced a positive change in their lives and appreciate the state government's efforts constitute 80 per cent, he told ANI.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"20 per cent are those people who always oppose everything. They opposed everything before and will continue doing so now. They have negative thinking. They back money and crime and will remain so. This is how this election is that of 80 versus 20,\" he said.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">After the first phase of the elections, it is clear that it really is a poll of 80 versus 20, Adityanath said. \"80 per cent of people have supported BJP, and 20 per cent are those who wanted to oppose. (They) opposed (COVID) vaccine, Ann Yojana, Expressways, One District One Medical College plan...They have opposed everything and will continue doing so,\" he added.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Lauding Prime Minister Narendra Modi for \"changing the agenda of politics in India\", the Chief Minister said, \"The politics of caste, creed, the family has been replaced by the politics of development, good governance, and betterment of villages, poor, farmers, youth, and women.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"It is because of PM Modi's vision that development work has happened in Uttar Pradesh and our manifesto for the polls reflects our resolution. It shows the BJP's dedication to the public. The party has released its manifesto based on development, respect for faith and welfare of the poor. We have done it before, and are doing it now,\" he said. The second phase of polling for the state Assembly is scheduled for February 14.

The BJP also blamed main opposition party, the Congress for polarizing the election in the name of religion and said that people of the devbhoomi are going to give befitting reply to the politics of appeasement.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The ruling BJP in Uttarakhand sought votes on development plank under the double engine government and warned voters against the appeasement policy of the Congress.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">BJP national general secretary and Uttarakhand in-charge, Dushyant Gautam told IANS that the way people voluntarily came out to vote clearly shows that their blessing is with the BJP.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">“The trend and feedback received till late afternoon clearly shows voters voluntarily coming out to make Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP victorious in the assembly polls. People are blessing to the PM’s call to make it a decade of Uttarakhand. People do not want any experiment and are supporting the BJP to take the state to new height of development. We will form the next government in Uttarakhand with huge majority,” Gautam said.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">When asked why at end of campaign chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami promised about implementing Uniform Civil Code (UCC), Gautam said, “When other party is trying to polarize to appease a particular community, society reacts and thinks about its security. Whats wrong in talking about UCC as it is equal for everyone. There is no communal incident in the last five years in Uttarakhand during BJP rule, but Congress is trying to divide the society for its small political benefits.”</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">In 2017 assembly polls, the BJP won 57 of 70 seats. Congress won 11 and two independents won assembly segments. Since its formation in 2000, power in Uttarakhand has changed every five years between the BJP and the Congress. —IANS</span></p>",

Technology, he said, can really help us democratize basic amenities, such as Healthcare through Telemedicine, Education through EdTech.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">“For example, why are we making the ONDC, the Open Network for Digital Commerce? The idea is that the small retailers should be protected also. We are OK with the large eCommerce also contributing to the nation’s economy and working their way through. But should the small retailers be allowed to become extinct like in the Western world, where Mom &amp; Pop stores are almost gone or should we not protect livelihoods,” said Shri Goyal, interacting with students after addressing the Policy Conclave 2022 today, organised by IIT Kanpur.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Shri Goyal said the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, thinking about the welfare of 135 crore citizens, has given us a vision for India @2047, which is called the Amrit Kaal.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">“Unless you have ambitious targets, unless you dream big, unless you have significantly large hopes, aspirations, desires, you can never achieve greatness. There was a time when our population was considered a curse, but Prime Minister Modi has converted that entire thinking to talking about our young population as our biggest strength. Our demographic dividend gives us huge opportunities, opens the doors to a very bright future for the country! And therefore we need a holistic vision which envisions growth in all sectors, makes it easier to do business, promotes innovation, research, development, modernity and yet also respects family values, our culture, makes it easier to live, that we call Ease of Living for every single citizen,” he said earlier during his address.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Shri Goyal said India’s tryst with destiny must not merely remain a wishful rendezvous but must transform into prosperity, progress &amp; development. “And in that journey, IIT-Kanpur and all the IITs will be at the forefront, I have no doubt in that,” he said.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Shri Goyal gave a Five Point Action Plan for IIT students to unleash India’s golden era:</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">In all your ventures, make Scale, Quality, &amp; Job Creation the focal point</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Provide innovative solutions for farmers, artisans &amp; weavers, small retailers, etc &amp; help realise the goals of Aatmanirbhar Bharat &amp; Make in India for the World</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Study digital platforms (e.g. Single Window, PM GatiShakti, ONDC) &amp; give ideas to enhance facilities</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Help set the agenda/themes for India’s G20 presidency starting in Dec’22</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Make Seva &amp; Samarpan your guiding philosophy &amp; give back to the nation</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Shri Goyal said IIT-K is the pride of India and the world from being the 1st institute in India to offer Computer Science stream to being home to distinguished alumni like Mr. Narayana Murthy (Founder, Infosys), Arvind Krishna (CEO, IBM) &amp; Mukesh Bansal (Founder, Myntra &amp; CEO Cure.fit) to name a few.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Shri Goyal said the Satellite city of Kanpur is rich in history and culture.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">“From inspiring Maharishi Valmiki to write ‘The Ramayana’ to creating world class engineers, Kanpur is integral to India’s progress,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Kanpur (The Hawk):</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">&nbsp;In pursuit of developing low cost, indigenous technologies, experts of National Sugar Institute, Kanpur have developed an automation system for controlling water requirement for condensers of vacuum system. In sugar factories juices and other sugar liquors are boiled under vacuum so as to enable low temperature boiling to minimize colour development and sugar losses. By doing so, instead of carrying out boiling at 103-105 deg. C, the boiling is made at 55-60 deg. C. In conventional condensers, vacuum is created by injecting cold water to condense water vapours and extract air. Generally, the quantity of water for the purpose is not regulated as per vapour load and thus even under the circumstances when lesser quantities of vapours are to be condensed, the water quantity remains same. Thus, unnecessarily higher amount of injection water is pumped necessitating higher power consumption. In the system developed under the supervision of Mr Virendra Kumar, Senior Instrumentation Engineer and installed in Experimental Sugar Factory of the institute, the quantity of injection water is controlled sensing vacuum, vapour temperature, injection water and outlet water temperature. The trials confirm lesser water requirement and thus decrease in power consumption by around 25 per cent. Although there are few systems available for the purpose, but NSI wanted to develop a low cost and sturdy system which is user friendly too. It’s installation in Experimental Sugar Factory shall give a wider exposure to the students about innovative techniques being used for reducing energy requirements in sugar industry, said the Director, NSI, Prof Narendra Mohan. In a sugar factory of 5000 TCD (tonnes cane per day), adoption of such systems with variable frequency drives at pumps may result in saving of 4000 units of power per day, he added.—KA</span></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">New Delhi (The Hawk):&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">A team of Indian Scientists has recently identified the next-generation probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus Plantarum JBC5 from a dairy product that showed great promise in promoting healthy aging. The team has also developed a yogurt using this probiotic bacterium which can be consumed to derive all these health benefits.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The recent advances in medical science have increased life expectancy and have led to the rapid growth of the aging population. The United Nations forecasts that one in every eleven people will be older than 65 by 2050. However, aging is generally associated with a higher risk of age-related health issues, such as obesity, neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson's, Alzheimer's), cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, autoimmune diseases, and inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, it raises concerns in highly populated countries like India and flags the need for scientific ways to promote healthy aging.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">A team of scientists at the Institute of Advanced Study in Science and Technology (IASST), Guwahati, an autonomous institute of the Department of Science &amp; Technology, Govt. of India, searched for healthy bacteria to promote healthy living in fermented dairy products following the proposal of Nobel laureate Dr. Elie Metchnikoff</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">They discovered the next-generation probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus Plantarum JBC5 from a dairy product that shows great promise in promoting healthy aging on a model organism called Caenorhabditis Elegans --- a free-living, transparent nematode living temperate soil environments.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The study led by Dr. Mojibur R. Khan, Associate Professor and Prof. Ashis K. Mukherjee, Director, in collaboration with Prof. M. C. Kalita of Guwahati University and research scholars, Mr. Arun Kumar and Ms. Tulsi Joishy has shown that Lactobacillus Plantarum JBC5 improves longevity and healthy aging by modulating antioxidative, innate immunity and serotonin-signaling pathways in Caenorhabditis elegans. It was recently published in the journal ‘Antioxidant’.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Dr. M. R. Khan said that the bacterium demonstrated a 27.81% increase in the life span of the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans accompanied by the hallmarks of healthy aging by providing improved immunity against pathogenic infections increased learning ability and memory, gut integrity, and oxidative stress tolerance. In contrast, it significantly reduced the accumulation of body fat and inflammation.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Prof. Mukherjee, Director of IASST, opined that the probiotic promises to delay the onset of age-associated diseases, such as obesity, a decline in cognitive functions, and immunity in the elderly.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The team has also developed a yogurt using this probiotic bacterium which can be consumed to derive all these health benefits. A patent has been filed (Indian patent application no: 202231001501). Professor Mukherjee hopes that the probiotic will be commercialized soon so that the laboratory-generated technology reaches general people.</span></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">New Delhi (The Hawk):&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Dr E. Poonguzhali, a single parent and woman scientist at the Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, has been granted a patent for developing a green methodology for producing a medicinally important compound called Benzo[b]thiophene.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The compound is present in a range of medicines such as raloxifene (used in osteoporosis), zileuton (used in asthma), and sertaconazole (antifungal medication) and the one-step synthesis of the 2-substituted benzo[b]thiophene can replace hazardous industrial production of the compound.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Currently, available synthesis methods of the compound like Friedel–Craft acylation, mercaptoacetate reaction, subsequent addition and oxidation etc. - all give yields ranging from good to excellent, but these are not environmentally friendly. Besides, it involves the use of very high temperatures. The disadvantages include sulphur emission with an unpleasant smell, expensive starting materials and so on. Apart from this, the reactions are carried out in closed vessels exposing the process to the risk of explosion, use of OLED lights required in the reaction increased the cost of the process, and the various steps involved needs close monitoring while the metal catalyst needed for it is toxic in nature.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Dr Poonguzhali has successfully transferred commercially available starting materials to medicinally important 2-acylbenzo[b]thiophenes in the presence of copper acetate and tetrabutylammonium chloride catalytic system in water medium and open-air atmosphere at room temperature. She worked under the WOMEN SCIENTISTS SCHEME (WOS-A) Programme of the Department of Science &amp; Technology (DST), Govt. of India. The new method involves using water medium, room temperature, odourless xanthate, open-air atmosphere, handling free inexpensive commercially available starting materials and catalysts in a one-pot manner. It furnished a good to an excellent yield of 2-acylbenzo[b]thiophenes.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Dr. E. Poonguzhali and Prof. G. Sekar treated commercially available 2-iodobenzaldehyde, phenacyl bromide, and xanthate sulphur source in the presence of copper acetate and tetrabutylammonium chloride catalyst to furnish 2-acylbenzo[b]thiophene in water medium at room temperature. The thiolate by-product formed usage is being explored. The remaining side products can be recovered using their solubility properties and reused after purification. The new method also reduces the risk of explosion, decreases the cost of the process and obviates the toxic and hazardous steps involved.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Elaborating on the science behind the mechanism, Dr Poonguzhali said that as water is the medium, no need for organic solvent is involved. Besides, there is no air pollution. Room temperature saves energy, and directly transferring the commercially available starting materials to medicinally essential building blocks in a one-pot manner saves workforce, energy and space. Usage of the thiolate by-product is under process. At the same time, the other side products (KI and KBr) and catalyst (copper acetate and tetrabutylammonium chloride) can be recovered and reused for the same reaction and different applications.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">“My family had encouraged me to invent green methodology to replace the hazardous methods. When I started my research career with DST support, I designed the green methodology with the help of Prof. G. Sekar and Prof. Ramesh L. Gardas and succeeded in synthesizing the medicinally important compounds,” said Dr Poonguzhali. Dr Poonguzhali adds, “My life revolves around my son and my research. My son’s support has helped me overcome the difficulties I have encountered so far and spend time on my research.”</span></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Leicester (England):</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">&nbsp;Saturn is the sixth planet in the solar system which has extremely large and bright rings around it. Now, Leicester space scientists have discovered a never-before-seen mechanism fuelling huge planetary aurorae at Saturn.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The study was published in in 'Geophysical Research Letters'.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Saturn is unique among planets observed to date, in that some of its aurorae are generated by swirling winds within its own atmosphere, and not just from the planet's surrounding magnetosphere.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">At all other observed planets, including Earth, aurorae are only formed by powerful currents that flow into the planet's atmosphere from the surrounding magnetosphere. These are driven by either interaction with charged particles from the Sun (as at the Earth) or volcanic material erupted from a moon orbiting the planet (as at Jupiter and Saturn).</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">This discovery changed scientists' understanding of planetary aurorae and answers one of the first mysteries raised by NASA's Cassini probe, which reached Saturn in 2004: why can't we easily measure the length of a day on the Ringed Planet?</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">When it first arrived at Saturn, Cassini tried to measure the bulk rotation rate of the planet, that determines the length of its day, by tracking radio emission 'pulses' from Saturn's atmosphere. To the great surprise of those making the measurements, they found that the rate appeared to have changed over the two decades since the last spacecraft to have flown past the planet - Voyager 2, also operated by NASA - in 1981. Leicester PhD researcher Nahid Chowdhury is a member of the Planetary Science Group within the School of Physics and Astronomy and corresponding author for the study.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">He said, \"Saturn's internal rotation rate has to be constant, but for decades researchers have shown that numerous periodic properties related to the planet - the very measurements we've used at other planets to understand the internal rotation rate, such as the radio emission - tend to change with time. What's more, there are also independent periodic features seen in the northern and southern hemispheres which themselves vary over the course of a season on the planet.\" \"Our understanding of the physics of planetary interiors tells us the true rotation rate of the planet can't change this quickly, so something unique and strange must be happening at Saturn. Several theories have been touted since the advent of the NASA Cassini mission trying to explain the mechanism/s behind these observed periodicities. This study represents the first detection of the fundamental driver, situated in the upper atmosphere of the planet, which goes on to generate both the observed planetary periodicities and aurorae,\" he added.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"It's absolutely thrilling to be able to provide an answer to one of the longest standing questions in our field. This is likely to initiate some rethinking about how local atmospheric weather effects on a planet impact the creation of aurorae, not just in our own Solar System but farther afield too,\" he said.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Astronomers and planetary scientists based at the University of Leicester led a study alongside colleagues from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and the Universities of Wisconsin-Madison, Boston, and Lancaster, plus Imperial and University Colleges, London, to resolve the decades-old question.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">They measured infrared emissions from the gas giant's upper atmosphere using the Keck Observatory in Hawaii and mapped the varying flows of Saturn's ionosphere, far below the magnetosphere, over the course of a month in 2017. This map, when fixed against the known pulse of Saturn's radio aurorae, showed that a significant proportion of the planet's aurorae are generated by the swirling pattern of weather in its atmosphere and are responsible for the planet's observed variable rate of rotation. Researchers believe the system is driven by energy from Saturn's thermosphere, with winds in the ionosphere observed between 0.3 and 3.0 kilometres per second.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Dr Tom Stallard, Associate Professor in Planetary Astronomy at the University of Leicester, added, \"The University of Leicester has long been involved in measuring the effects of this new discovery - we've observed how the pulsing aurorae and the wobbling magnetic field lines stretching out into space highlight an apparently changing rotation rate. For two decades our researchers, along with the wider scientific community, have speculated about what might be driving these strange periodicities.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">He continued, \"Over the years, scientific meetings have had late-night discussions about whether the volcanic moon Enceladus might be the cause, or interactions with the thick atmosphere of the moon Titan, or perhaps interactions with Saturn's bright rings. But recently, many researchers have focused on the possibility that it is Saturn's upper atmosphere that causes this variability.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"This search for a new type of aurora harks back to some of the earliest theories about Earth's aurora. We now know that aurorae on Earth are powered by interactions with the stream of charged particles driven from the Sun. But I love that the name Aurora Borealis originates from the 'the Dawn of the Northern Wind'. These observations have revealed that Saturn has a true Aurora Borealis - the first ever aurora driven by the winds in the atmosphere of a planet,\" he said.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Dr Kevin Baines, a JPL-Caltech-based co-author of the study and a member of the Cassini Science Team, added,\"Our study, by conclusively determining the origin of the mysterious variability in radio pulses, eliminates much of the confusion into Saturn's bulk rotation rate and the length of the day on Saturn.\" Because of the variable rotation rates observed at Saturn, scientists have been prevented from using the regular pulse of radio emission to calculate the bulk internal rotation rate. Fortunately, a novel method was developed by Cassini scientists using gravity-induced perturbations in Saturn's complex ring system, which seemed to be the most accurate means of measuring the planet's bulk rotational period and was determined in 2019 to be 10 hours, 33 minutes and 38 seconds.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Planetary research at the University of Leicester spanned the breadth of our Solar System - and beyond.&nbsp;—ANI</span></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">London:&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The past always has always intrigued scientists, whether be it searching for answers on survival or questioning the existence of some species. Scientists from the Natural History Museum, London (United Kingdom), and the ESRF, the European Synchrotron, Grenoble (France), have found that some pollen has survived mass extinctions thanks, in part, to its nanofoam wall structure. This had the key to explain the survival of certain plants.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">It was the first time that scientists described a biological nanofoam structure. Their results were published in 'Science Advances'.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Pollen grains protected plant's genetic material from environmental threats during reproduction and are therefore vital to the survival of plants. For this purpose, the earliest land plants evolved a tough outer wall of their pollen grains, produced from a highly resistant organic polymer, known as sporopollenin.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Thanks to this shield, plants like conifer trees, which have been around for 300-400 million years, survived several mass extinctions, including the one that wiped out dinosaurs, at the end of the Cretaceous. Now, the scientists have found out how conifer pollen has adapted, thanks to experiments carried out at the ESRF.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">A team of scientists from the ESRF and the Natural History Museum (NHM), including palynologists, material scientists and physicists, joined forces to discover the pollen wall's secrets. They chose to analyse conifer pollen as it has a longer evolutionary history than that of flowering plant pollen and could be compared very effectively with fossil material from the NHM collections.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">They carried out experiments on the pollen wall using X-ray nanotomography and X-ray fluorescence nano-imaging on beamline ID16A at the ESRF. Alexandra Pacureanu, researcher at the ESRF and co-corresponding author of the paper, explained the importance of these techniques in getting a faithful picture of pollen, \"The unique capabilities of these technologies enabled us to probe for the first time the nanoscale 3D structure and the native elemental composition in intact grains, without resorting to staining, embedding in resin or sectioning\".</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">For Stephen Stukins, palynologist at the Natural History Museum in London (United Kingdom), and also co-corresponding author, it was his first time at a synchrotron, \"The experiment was challenging as it required samples of less than 100 microns in size and under cryogenic conditions. It was a very successful experiment because in the team we had four scientists from the ESRF who brought in their expertise on all the technical aspect\", he said.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The data showed, for the first time, a nanofoam structure made by nature. \"The foam is an adaptation to protect the genetic code of the organism. It has helped the plant group survive all the environmental and climatic aggressions that have occurred during the last few hundred million years: chemical and physical attacks, acid rain or UV radiation, as examples\", explained Stukins.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The team also used the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) at the ESRF to compare the pollen wall with other natural and synthetic foams and found that the mechanical properties were consistent across all materials and therefore confirm the nanofoam hypothesis.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"This new quantitative characterisation of the pollen wall is important for present and future applications of this material\", said Marie Capron, materials scientist at the ESRF. The pharmaceutical industry is researching pollen as a drug encapsulation and targeted release mechanism, so the new findings could potentially help with understanding this process.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The nanofoam insight may also serve the scientific community using pollen as a template to design biomimetic materials. The next step for the team would be to find out more about the role that the foam carried out in the pollen, how it pollinates and why some pollen has nanofoam and others do not.&nbsp;—ANI</span></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Bonn (Germany):&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The Standard Model of Cosmology has described how the universe came into being according to the view of most physicists. Now, researchers at the University of Bonn studied the evolution of galaxies within this model and found considerable discrepancies with actual observations.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The University of St. Andrews in Scotland and Charles University in the Czech Republic were also involved in the study. The results were published in the 'Astrophysical Journal'.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Most galaxies visible from Earth resemble a flat disk with a thickened center. They are therefore similar to the sports equipment of a discus thrower. According to the Standard Model of Cosmology, however, such disks should form rather rarely. This was because, in the model, every galaxy was surrounded by a halo of dark matter. This halo was invisible, but exerted a strong gravitational pull, on nearby galaxies due to its mass. \"That's why we keep seeing galaxies merging with each other in the model universe,\" explained Prof. Dr Pavel Kroupa of the Helmholtz Institute for Radiation and Nuclear Physics at the University of Bonn. This crash has two effects, the physicist explained, \"First, the galaxies penetrate in the process, destroying the disk shape. Second, it reduces the angular momentum of the new galaxy created by the merger.\" Put simply, this greatly decreased its rotational speed. The rotating motion normally ensured that the centrifugal forces acting during this process cause a new disk to form. However, if the angular momentum is too small, a new disk will not form at all.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">In the current study, Kroupa's doctoral student, Moritz Haslbauer, led an international research group to investigate the evolution of the universe using the latest supercomputer simulations. The calculations are based on the Standard Model of Cosmology; they show which galaxies should have formed by today if this theory were correct. The researchers then compared their results with what is currently probably the most accurate observational data of the real Universe visible from Earth.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"Here we encountered a significant discrepancy between prediction and reality,\" said Haslbauer.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">He added, \"There are apparently significantly more flat disk galaxies than can be explained by theory.\" However, the resolution of the simulations is limited even on today's supercomputers. It may therefore be that the number of disk galaxies that would form in the Standard Model of Cosmology has been underestimated. \"However, even if we take this effect into account, there remains a serious difference between theory and observation that cannot be remedied\", Haslbauer pointed out.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The situation was different for an alternative to the Standard Model, which dispensed with dark matter. According to the so-called MOND theory (the acronym stands for \"MilgrOmiaN Dynamics), galaxies did not grow by merging with each other. Instead, they formed from rotating gas clouds that became more and more condensed. In a MOND universe, galaxies also grew by absorbing gas from their surroundings. However, mergers of full-grown galaxies are rare in MOND. \"Our research group in Bonn and Prague has uniquely developed the methods to do calculations in this alternative theory,\" said Kroupa, who is also a member of the Transdisciplinary Research Units \"Modelling\" and \"Matter\" at the University of Bonn. \"MOND's predictions are consistent with what we actually see.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">However, the exact mechanisms of galaxy growth are not yet fully understood, even with MOND. Additionally, in MOND, Newton's laws of gravity did not apply under certain circumstances, but needed to be replaced by the correct ones. This would have far-reaching consequences for other areas of physics. \"Nevertheless, the MOND theory solves all known extragalactic cosmological problems despite being originally formulated to address galaxies only,\" said Dr Indranil Banik, who was involved in this research. \"Our study proves that young physicists today still have the opportunity to make significant contributions to fundamental physics,\" Kroupa added.&nbsp;—ANI</span></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Washington:&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The tiny looking mosquitoes that hum a tune every time they cross our ears are vectors of some of the most dangerous diseases known to mankind. Now, new research led by scientists at the University of Washington indicates that a common mosquito species (after detecting a tell-tale gas that we exhale) flies toward specific colours, including red, orange, black and cyan. The mosquitoes ignore other colours, such as green, purple, blue and white.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The researchers believed that these findings helped explain how mosquitoes found hosts, since human skin, regardless of overall pigmentation, emitted a strong red-orange \"signal\" to their eyes. The results were published in 'Nature Communications'.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"Mosquitoes appear to use odours to help them distinguish what is nearby, like a host to bite,\" said senior author Jeffrey Riffell, a UW professor of biology. \"When they smell specific compounds, like CO2 from our breath, that scent stimulates the eyes to scan for specific colours and other visual patterns, which are associated with a potential host, and head to them.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The results revealed how the mosquito sense of smell -- known as olfaction -- influenced how the mosquito responded to visual cues. Knowing which colours attract hungry mosquitoes, and which ones do not, can help design better repellents, traps and other methods to keep mosquitoes at bay.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"One of the most common questions I'm asked is 'What can I do to stop mosquitoes from biting me?'\" said Riffell. \"I used to say there are three major cues that attract mosquitoes: your breath, your sweat and the temperature of your skin. In this study, we found a fourth cue: the colours red, which can not only be found on your clothes, but is also found in everyone's skin. The shade of your skin doesn't matter, we are all giving off a strong red signature. Filtering out those attractive colourss in our skin, or wearing clothes that avoid those colourss, could be another way to prevent a mosquito biting.\" In their experiments, the team tracked behaviour of female yellow fever mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti, when presented with different types of visual and scent cues. Like all mosquito species, only females drink blood, and bites from A. aegypti can transmit dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika. The researchers tracked individual mosquitoes in miniature test chambers, into which they sprayed specific odors and presented different types of visual patterns -- such as a coloured dot or a tasty human hand.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Without any odour stimulus, mosquitoes largely ignored a dot at the bottom of the chamber, regardless of colours. After a spritz of CO2 into the chamber, mosquitos continued to ignore the dot if it was green, blue or purple in colours. But if the dot was red, orange, black or cyan, mosquitoes would fly toward it.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Humans can't smell CO2, which is the gas we and other animals exhale with each breath. Mosquitoes can. Past research by Riffell's team and other groups showed that smelling CO2 boosts female mosquitoes' activity level -- searching the space around them, presumably for a host. The coloured-dot experiments revealed that after smelling CO2, these mosquitoes' eyes prefer certain wavelengths in the visual spectrum. It's similar to what might happen when humans smell something good. \"Imagine you're on a sidewalk and you smell pie crust and cinnamon,\" said Riffell. \"That's probably a sign that there's a bakery nearby, and you might start looking around for it. Here, we started to learn what visual elements that mosquitoes are looking for after smelling their own version of a bakery.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Most humans have \"true colours\" vision: We see different wavelengths of light as distinct colours: 650 nanometers show up as red, while 450 nanometer wavelengths look blue, for example. The researchers do not know whether mosquitoes perceive colours the same way that our eyes do. But most of the colourss the mosquitoes prefer after smelling CO2 -- orange, red and black -- correspond to longer wavelengths of light. Human skin, regardless of pigmentation, also gives off a long-wavelength signal in the red-orange range.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">When Riffell's team repeated the chamber experiments with human skin-tone pigmentation cards -- or a researcher's bare hand -- mosquitoes again flew toward the visual stimulus only after CO2 was sprayed into the chamber. If the researchers used filters to remove long-wavelength signals, or had the researcher wear a green-coloured glove, then CO2-primed mosquitoes no longer flew toward the stimulus.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Genes determine the preference of these females for red-orange colours. Mosquitoes with a mutant copy of a gene needed to smell CO2 no longer showed a colours preference in the test chamber. Another strain of mutant mosquitoes, with a change related to vision so they could no longer \"see\" long wavelengths of light, were more colours-blind in the presence of CO2. \"These experiments lay out the first steps mosquitoes use to find hosts,\" said Riffell.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">More research is needed to determine how other visual and odour cues -- such as skin secretions -- help mosquitoes target potential hosts at close range. Other mosquito species may also have different colours preferences, based on their preferred host species. But these new findings added a new layer to mosquito control: colours.&nbsp;—ANI</span></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">New Delhi (The Hawk):&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">&nbsp;A recent study conducted by Indian Scientists has indicated that regions over Bay of Bengal, South China Sea, and South Indian Ocean can experience higher wave activity in the future, posing serious threat for coastal communities in the region.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Coastal communities are one of those most vulnerable to impacts of climate change and other environmental drivers due to their exposure to severe inundation and its frequency associated with extreme water levels in the nearshore regions. Impact resulting from coastal inundation can significantly affect the shoreline configuration, damage to infrastructure, saltwater intrusion into groundwater, destruction of crops, and affect the human population with a range of socio-economic consequences. Scientists around the world are trying the estimate the magnitude of this impact.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The present study performed a detailed investigation on future extreme wind-wave projections and its relationship with wind speed, sea level pressure, and sea surface temperature for the mid-and end-century under two different greenhouse gas emission scenarios projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) called RCP4.5 and RCP8.5.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Analysis of the projections have indicated maximum extreme wind and wave activity over the South Indian Ocean region during June-July-August and September-October-November. Regions over the central Bay of Bengal show extreme wind activity from the end-century projections, signifying the likelihood for more extreme events. Extreme wave heights are seen to intensify by about 1 m over the South Indian Ocean during the June-July-August months. An increase of 0.4 m in maximum significant wave heights are projected over regions in the North Indian Ocean, northwest Arabian Sea, northeast Bay of Bengal, and South China Sea. A team of scientists Athira Krishnan and Prasad K. Bhaskaran from the Department of Ocean Engineering &amp; Naval Architecture, IIT Kharagpur, jointly with Prashant Kumar, Department of Applied Sciences, National Institute of Technology Delhi with the support from the Department of Science &amp; Technology, Government of India under the Climate Change Programme (CCP), carried out this study which was published in the journal ‘Climate Dynamics’, Springer recently.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Findings from the study show that the projected change in wave heights are maximum for the South China Sea in RCP4.5, whereas the maximum rise is about 23% in RCP8.5 by the end of the end-century. Also, the projected change in winds and waves over the western tropical Indian Ocean is consistent with changes in sea-level pressure variations and warm ocean temperatures. Significant increment in sea surface temperature is projected over the Arabian Sea during December-January-February and June-July-August months ranging between 1.5 and 2.0º C, that is 0.5º C greater than Bay of Bengal. Projections show that regions over the Gulf of Oman and Persian Gulf can experience higher warming rates exceeding 2º C under RCP8.5 by the end-century.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The team elaborates that seasonal signatures in the extreme wind-wave patterns over the Indian Ocean directly correlate with the location of extreme wind activity. The end-century projections identified the hotspot locations of extreme wind activity over the central Bay of Bengal with magnitudes reaching 13-15 m/s, demarcating the likelihood of more extreme events in this region. Projected changes during the mid-and end-century showed a dipole behavior or seesaw effect having two distinct dipoles over the western and eastern regions in the tropical Indian Ocean belt. Regions in the northern, central, and eastern sectors of the Bay of Bengal, the southern part of the South China Sea, northern and western regions of Arabian Sea, and eastern tropical Indian Ocean can witness changes ranging from 1-1.25 m by the end-century under the extreme RCP forcing scenario.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The new findings from this study are expected to augment more advanced research on extreme wind-wave activity for the North Indian Ocean region and also provide the scope for a detailed investigation on the possible linkages and teleconnection with climate indices in a changing climate.</span></p>",

The moon also stabilises Earth's axis of rotation, which in turn stabilises its mild climate, which is favorable for life.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">According to the scientists, the Moon was born from a cataclysmic collision of a nascent Earth with a Mars-size world known as Theia.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">This impact stirred up a huge amount of material, part of which turned into vapour in the heat generated by the impact. For some time, this material circled Earth in a disk similar to the ring system of Saturn. The material in this disk, scientists believe, gradually gave rise to smaller moonlets, which subsequently merged to form one large moon, the report said.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The new study, based on computer modelling, found that if larger planets collide, the energy of the impact is such that all of the ejected material vapourises rather than part of it. And that makes a difference.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The large amount of vapour around the planet creates drag, which gradually slows down the moonlets as they orbit the planet, making them crash onto its surface, the study found.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The findings might help astronomers fine-tune their search for potentially habitable planets. They simply have to focus on those that can have a large moon compared to their size, the report said.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"By understanding moon formations, we have a better constraint on what to look for when searching for Earth-like planets,\" study lead author Miki Nakajima, an assistant professor of earth and environmental sciences at the University of Rochester, said in a statement.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"We expect that exomoons [moons orbiting planets outside our solar system] should be everywhere, but so far we haven't confirmed any. Our constraints will be helpful for future observations.\" —IANS</span></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Hawaii (US):&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Mini-Neptunes are a class of exoplanets, which are planets that orbit stars outside our solar system. These worlds, which are smaller, denser versions of the planet Neptune, consist of large rocky cores surrounded by thick blankets of gas. Studies have identified two different cases of \"mini-Neptune\" planets, that are losing their puffy atmospheres and likely transforming into super-Earths.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The findings are published in two separate papers in 'The Astronomical Journal'. One is based on data from W. M. Keck Observatory on Maunakea, Hawaii and the other paper involves observations from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. Together, the studies help paint a picture of how exotic worlds like these, form and evolve.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Radiation from the planets' stars is stripping away their atmospheres, driving hot gas to escape like steam from a pot of boiling water.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"Most astronomers suspected that young, small mini-Neptunes must have evaporating atmospheres,\" said Michael Zhang, lead author of both studies and a graduate student at Caltech. \"But nobody had ever caught one in the process of doing so until now.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Mini-Neptunes are a class of exoplanets, which are planets that orbit stars outside our solar system. These worlds, which are smaller, denser versions of the planet Neptune, consist of large rocky cores surrounded by thick blankets of gas.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">In the new studies, a team of astronomers led by Caltech used Keck Observatory's Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSPEC) to study one of two mini-Neptune planets in the star system called TOI 560, located 103 light-years away; and they used Hubble to look at two mini-Neptunes orbiting HD 63433, located 73 light-years away.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Their results showed that atmospheric gas is escaping from the innermost mini-Neptune in TOI 560, called TOI 560.01, and from the outermost mini-Neptune in HD 63433, called HD 63433 c.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Furthermore, Keck Observatory data surprisingly showed the gas around TOI 560.01 was escaping predominantly toward the star.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"This was unexpected, as most models predict that the gas should flow away from the star,\" said Professor of Planetary Science Heather Knutson, Zhang's advisor and a co-author of the study. \"We still have a lot to learn about how these outflows work in practice.\" Since the first exoplanets orbiting Sun-like stars were discovered in the mid-1990s, thousands of others have been found. Many of these, orbit close to their stars, and the smaller, rocky ones generally fall into two groups: mini-Neptunes and super-Earths. The super-Earths are as large as 1.6 times the size of Earth (and occasionally as large as 1.75 times the size of Earth), while the mini-Neptunes are between two and four times the size of Earth. Few planets with sizes between these two planet types have been detected. One possible explanation for this gap can be that mini-Neptunes are transforming into super-Earths. The mini-Neptunes are theorized to be cocooned by primordial atmospheres made of hydrogen and helium. The hydrogen and helium are left over from the formation of the central star, which is born out of clouds of gas. If a mini-Neptune is small enough and close enough to its star, stellar X-rays and ultraviolet radiation can strip away its primordial atmosphere over a period of hundreds of millions of years, scientists theorize. This would then leave behind a rocky super-Earth with a substantially smaller radius, which could, in theory, still retain a relatively thin atmosphere similar to that surrounding our own planet.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"A planet in the gap would have enough atmosphere to puff up its radius, making it intercept more stellar radiation and thereby enabling fast mass loss,\" said Zhang. \"But the atmosphere is thin enough that it gets lost quickly. This is why a planet wouldn't stay in the gap for long.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Other scenarios could explain the gap, according to the astronomers. For instance, the smaller rocky planets might have never gathered gas envelopes in the first place, and mini-Neptunes could be water worlds and not enveloped in hydrogen gas. This latest discovery of two mini-Neptunes with escaping atmospheres represents the first direct evidence to support the theory that mini-Neptunes are indeed turning into super-Earths.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The astronomers were able to detect the escaping atmospheres by watching the mini-Neptunes cross in front of, or transit, their host stars. The planets cannot be seen directly but when they pass in front of their stars as seen from our point of view on Earth, telescopes can look for absorption of starlight by atoms in the planets' atmospheres. In the case of the mini-Neptune TOI 560.01, the researchers found signatures of helium. For the star system HD 63433, the team found signatures of hydrogen in the outermost planet they studied, called HD 63433 c, but not the inner planet, HD 63433 b.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"The inner planet may have already lost its atmosphere,\" Zhang explains. The speed of the gases provides the evidence that the atmospheres are escaping. The observed helium around TOI 560.01 is moving as fast as 20 kilometers per second, while the hydrogen around HD 63433 c is moving as fast as 50 kilometers per second. The gravity of these mini-Neptunes is not strong enough to hold on to such fast-moving gas. The extent of the outflows around the planets also indicates escaping atmospheres: the cocoon of gas around TOI 560.01 is at least 3.5 times as large as the radius of the planet, and the cocoon around HD 63433 c is at least 12 times the radius of the planet.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">As for the strange discovery that the gas lost from TOI 560.01 was flowing toward -- instead of away from -- its host star, future observations of other mini-Neptunes should reveal if TOI 560.01 is an anomaly or whether an inward-moving atmospheric outflow is more common.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"As exoplanet scientists, we've learned to expect the unexpected,\" said Knutson. \"These exotic worlds are constantly surprising us with new physics that goes beyond what we observe in our solar system.\"&nbsp;—ANI</span></p>",

However, it has not yet been possible to develop synthetic muscle materials that are entirely bio-based and move autonomously with the help of chemical energy.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The material used by the Freiburg team is based on elastin, a natural fibrous protein that also occurs in humans, for instance giving elasticity to the skin and blood vessels. Following the model of this protein, the researchers developed two elastin-like proteins, one of which responds, for example, to fluctuations in pH, the other to changes in temperature.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The scientists combined the two proteins by means of photochemical cross-linking to form a bilayered material. It is possible in this process to flexibly shape the material and set the direction of its movement.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The researchers succeeded in inducing the rhythmic contractions by using a chemical energy source as fuel, in this case, sodium sulphite. In an oscillating chemical reaction in which the pH changes in cycles due to a special linkage of several reactions, the added energy was converted into mechanical energy via non-equilibrium states of the material. In this way, the researchers induced the material to contract autonomously in a cyclical manner. They were also able to switch the contractions on and off with the help of temperature changes. The oscillating chemical reaction started at a temperature of around 20 degrees Celsius, and the material began to make rhythmic movements. In the process, it was possible to program certain states for the material to assume and to reset them again with another stimulus. The scientists thus achieved a simple system for implementing learning and forgetting at the material level.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"Since it is derived from the naturally occurring protein elastin and is produced by us through biotechnological means, our material is marked by a high sustainability that is also relevant for technical applications,\" explained Schiller.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"In the future, the material could be developed further to respond to other stimuli, such as the salt concentration in the environment, and to consume other energy sources, such as malate derived from biomass,\" he added.&nbsp;—ANI</span></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Boston (Massachusetts):&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">A large study, conducted by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, has said that elderly people living near or downwind of unconventional oil and gas development (UOGD) are at higher risk of early death, compared to their counterparts who don't live there.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">UOGD involved extraction methods including directional (non-vertical) drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. The results, published in 'Nature Energy', suggested that airborne contaminants emitted by UOGD and transported downwind are contributing to increased mortality. \"Although UOGD is a major industrial activity in the U.S., very little is known about its public health impacts. Our study is the first to link mortality to UOGD-related air pollutant exposures,\" said Petros Koutrakis, professor of environmental sciences and senior author of the study.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Co-author Francesca Dominici, Clarence James Gamble Professor of Biostatistics, Population, and Data Science, added, \"There is an urgent need to understand the causal link between living near or downwind of UOGD and adverse health effects.\" UOGD has expanded rapidly over the past decade. As of 2015, according to the study, more than 100,000 UOGD land-based wells were drilled using directional drilling combined with fracking. Roughly 17.6 million U.S. residents currently live within one kilometre of at least one active well. Compared with conventional oil and gas drilling, UOGD generally involves longer construction periods and larger well pads (the area occupied by equipment or facilities), and requires larger volumes of water, proppants (sand or other materials used to keep hydraulic fractures open), and chemicals during the fracking process.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Prior studies have found connections between UOGD activities and increased human exposure to harmful substances in both air and water, as well as connections between UOGD exposure and adverse prenatal, respiratory, cardiovascular, and carcinogenic health outcomes. But little was known about whether exposure to UOGD was associated with mortality risk in the elderly, or about exactly how exposure to UOGD-related activities may be contributing to such risk.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">To learn more, the researchers studied a cohort of more than 15 million Medicare beneficiaries -- people aged 65 and older -- living in all major U.S. UOGD exploration regions from 2001 to 2015. They also gathered data from the records of more than 2.5 million oil and gas wells.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">For each Medicare beneficiary's ZIP code and year in the cohort, the researchers used two different statistical approaches to calculate what the exposure to pollutants would be from living either close to UOGD operations, downwind of them, or both, while adjusting for socioeconomic, environmental, and demographic factors.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The closer to UOGD wells people lived, the greater their risk of premature mortality, the study found. Those who lived closest to wells had a statistically significant elevated mortality risk (2.5 per cent higher) compared with those who didn't live close to wells.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The study also found that people who lived near UOGD wells as well as downwind of them were at higher risk of premature death than those living upwind, when both groups were compared with people who were unexposed.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">\"Our findings suggest the importance of considering the potential health dangers of situating UOGD near or upwind of people's homes,\" said Longxiang Li, postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Environmental Health and lead author of the study.&nbsp;—ANI</span></p>",

The basic objective of all guidelines remain an early detection of case for quick isolation and care. In addition, testing remains a key strategy for the pandemic management on two counts – identification of new clusters and new hotspots of infection which can in turn facilitate immediate action for containment such as setting up containment zones, contact tracing and others and ensuring reduction in mortality and morbidity, the letter read. Delineating on ICMR testing advisory issued on January 10, Arti Ahuja, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Health, said in the letter, “All those who are symptomatic must be tested in community settings. All at risk contacts of laboratory confirmed cases must also be tested”.</p><p>“In order to ensure that an effective track of the spread of the pandemic is kept and also immediate citizen centric action is initiated, it is incumbent upon all states and UTs to enhance the testing”, the letter further said.</p><p>—IANS</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>New Delhi:</strong>&nbsp;Even as the row over hijab (scarf) in educational institutions has gripped Karnataka, two videos have surfaced in the social media allegedly showing some students in the districts of Dakshina Kannada and Bagalkote performing namaz (prayers) in the school.</p><p>A video clip of the students allegedly offering namaz in the classroom of a government primary school in Dakshina Kannada has gone viral.</p><p>The incident that occurred on February four came to light when the clip was widely shared in the social media and the local people raised objections.</p><p>Following complaints, officials of the Education Department visited the school on Friday.&nbsp;The teachers there said they had ordered the students to not engage in religious activities in the classroom. The Department has directed its resource person to visit the school and submit a report on the incident immediately, Block Education Officer (BEO) C Lokesh said. Later, Lokesh said the issue was resolved at a meeting between the school authorities, students and their parents today.</p><p>The BEO, who attended the meeting, said the parents have promised that such activities will not be repeated by their children inside the school premises.</p><p>In the second instance, at least six students were seen performing namaz at a school in Bagalkote district. A few parents objected to the practice alleging that the school authorities permitted it to happen on the school premises.</p><p>The principal of the school told reporters in Ilkal that the students were directed not to perform any namaz on the campus. \"There are 232 students in the school. At the time of serving lunch, four students, means four girls from sixth standard, without my knowledge or any teacher performed namaz. Hence, today we told them not to do namaz and if at all you want you do it at home,\" she said.</p><p>On January 24, namaz by a few students in a government school at Mulbagal town in Kolar led to tension in the area. Parents of other students, alumni of the school and a few members of a caste organisation staged a protest in a school at Someshwarapalya for setting a new precedent of allowing Friday prayers.</p><p>The trigger was a viral video, which showed the students offering Friday prayers in a classroom. The row over hijab versus saffron scarves on the high school and college campuses in certain parts of the state had resulted in tension, untoward incidents and even taken a violent turn at some places.</p><p>The controversy had started towards December-end when a few women students in hijabs were denied entry into a college in Udupi. As a counter, some students turned up wearing saffron scarves.</p><p>On January 1, six girl students of a college in Udupi attended a press conference held by Campus Front of India (CFI) in the coastal town protesting against the college authorities denying them entry into the classroom by wearing hijab. This was four days after they requested the principal permission to wear hijabs in classes which was not allowed. Till then, students used to wear the hijab to the campus and entered the classroom after removing the scarves. \"The institution did not have any rule on hijab-wearing as such and since no one used to wear it to the classroom in the last 35 years. The students who came with the demand had the backing of outside forces,\" the college principal Rudre Gowda had said. Karnataka Minister V Sunil Kumar had alleged that the Congress is behind raking up the hijab issue for political gains. This was echoed by Udupi MLA K Raghupati Bhat who said Congress is worried about the growth of Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) in the region and wants to appease the minorities.</p><p>—PTI</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>New York</strong>: mRNA that are gene-based vaccines may not be a fix for all the problems with vaccine development, shows early data from clinical trials of Moderna's mRNA-based seasonal flu vaccine.</p><p>With the success of Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine, the company in July launched a clinical trial of an mRNA seasonal flu vaccine.</p><p>The results released by the drugmaker on Friday showed that the mRNA flu shots did generate antibodies, but the levels of those antibodies weren't higher than those for other flu shots already on the market. They also had more side effects than existing shots, The Verge reported.</p><p>Moderna's early data shows that \"the immune system is tricky and that mRNA vaccines probably aren't an easy shortcut for stopping a virus as persistent as the flu. More studies will be needed to figure out if there is a specific benefit to using mRNA vaccines to fight the flu\", chemist and writer Derek Lowe wrote in the journal Science.</p><p>The overwhelming success of the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines, made by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech, supercharged interest in that strategy for developing shots.</p><p>mRNA shots inject people with tiny snippets of the gene for a virus, which the body builds and then uses to learn how to fight the virus. They are faster to design and produce because manufacturers don't have to grow copies of the virus.</p><p>The new findings by Moderna do not necessarily mean that mRNA flu shots aren't any better than what we have now. Further, there's still a lot more data to collect on the efficacy of these vaccines. Moderna is preparing to conduct larger trials that would test how well the shots actually keep people from getting sick in the real world (not just testing antibody levels), the report said.</p><p>Participants in the Moderna study who received the 50 Aug dose, including older adults, achieved robust increases in geometric mean antibody titers against H1N1 and H3N2, the strains responsible for the vast majority of morbidity and mortality in this age group.</p><p>Seasonal flu (influenza A and influenza B) epidemics occur seasonally and vary in severity each year, causing respiratory illnesses and placing substantial burden on healthcare systems. The WHO estimates approximately 3-5 million severe cases of flu occur each year globally with 290,000-650,000 flu-related deaths annually.</p><p>\"Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, approximately three million people died each year due to respiratory infections, and many more are hospitalised or become ill as a result of these viruses,\" said Stephane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna, in a statement. \"We believe our mRNA platform is well-positioned to address the significant unmet need in seasonal flu,\" Bancel added.</p><p>—IANS</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">New Delhi:&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">With Omicron, the new variant of SARS-CoV2, the third wave of coronavirus could hit the peak by February with cases likely to be reaching up to 1-1.5 lakh a day in the country, but it will be milder than the second wave, Manindra Agarwal, IIT scientist involved in the mathematical projection of trajectory of COVID-19, said.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">He said in the new forecast, the new Omicron variant has been factored in.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">“With the new variant, our current forecast is that the country could see the third wave by February but it will be milder than the second wave. So far we have seen that the severity of Omicron is not like the one seen in the Delta variant,” Agarwal told PTI. He, however, said a close eye is being kept on cases in South Africa where many cases of this variant have been recorded. Agarwal added that as of now South Africa has not seen a rise in hospitalisation.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">He said a fresh set of data on the virus and hospitalisations would help in getting a more solid picture. “It looks like although the new variant has shown high transmissibility, its severity is not like the one seen in the Delta variant,” Agarwal said. He said as observed during the spread of delta, a mild lockdown (night curfew, restrictions on crowding) can bring down beta substantially. That will significantly reduce the peak value, he added. The Department of Science and Technology (DST) backed Sutra-model had earlier said the third wave of coronavirus could hit the country by October if a new variant, more virulent and transmissible than the Delta, emerges. However, till November end, there was no new variant. It had then revised its forecast to November.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">On November 26, the World Health Organisation (WHO) named the Covid-19 virus variant detected in South Africa and some other countries as Omicron.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The WHO has also classified the Omicron variant as a 'Variant of Concern'. Experts have expressed possibilities that owing to the genetic modification in the virus, it may possess some specific characteristics. While the transmissibility of infection seems to have increased because of this new variant, there is still not enough clarity on whether or not it will cause severe disease and whether it will evade immunity.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">More information is expected in the next two weeks' time or so, it said. India has so far reported 21 cases of the Omicron variant, including 17 on Sunday- nine persons from Rajasthan capital Jaipur, seven in Maharashtra's Pune district and a fully vaccinated man who arrived in Delhi from Tanzania.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">—PTI</span></p>",

We need the voices from low-income countries as well. They should be considered legitimate,\" Tvinnereim said.</p><p>Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen proposed a new separate global health fund, directly controlled by donors, as a global investment for pandemic prevention and preparedness.</p><p>Under her proposal, the fund will be used for delivering emergency funds, vaccines, and other medical needs.</p><p>Yellen said the fund would also help the developing and low-income countries improve the surveillance systems to prepare for future crises and help strengthen the countries' healthcare workforces.</p><p>Responding to the proposal, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus emphasized that \"any efforts to enhance the governance, systems and financing of global health security can only succeed if they also enhance the WHO's role\".</p><p>He said that the WHO, with its unique mandate, technical expertise and global legitimacy, should be made stronger and sustainably financed because the organisation played a central role in strengthening the global health architecture.</p><p>Indrawati said that it would not be an easy and simple process to build trust among countries.</p><p>\"That is why we are here to provide a platform to build trust together. We cannot do it alone. We should be open-minded to what challenges we are facing and what responsibility we can take.\"</p><p>Indrawati noted that the G20 meeting should be the momentum for parties concerned to start mobilising health financing for the importance of public goods.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Ashok Chatterjee</strong></p><p><strong>Kolkata (The Hawk):</strong> In the ongoing debate between Raj Bhavan and state secretariat Nabanna, West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar urged chief minister Mamata Banerjee to come to Raj Bhavan for discussions.</p><p>Dhankhar made the proposal through his letter to Mamata and also tweeted the letter through his handle.</p><p>The chief minister has already announced that she has blocked Dhankhar from her Twitter account. The Trinamool Congress has also urged for the recall of Dhankhar in parliament. Efforts have also begun to bring the chief ministers of non-BJP states under one umbrella in the context of central intervention regarding the appointment of governors.</p><p>In the light of these developments, the Bengal governor has invited the chief minister to the Raj Bhavan to resume stalled discussions on constitutional matters.</p><p>In the letter the governor has claimed his efforts to get the many pressing state issues be resolved have not borne fruit. His letter indicated urgency.</p><p>He wrote: …lack of response to issues flagged has potential to lead to constitutional stalemate which we both are ordained by our oath to avert.”</p><p>The Trinamool Congress, however, smells of political vendetta in the letter. Trinamool spokesperson and state secretary Kunal Ghosh claimed that the governor had to write a letter through Twitter as there is lack of intent on the part of the governor. The state BJP president Sukant Majumder feels that the chief minister should respond to the governor’s call.</p><p>The governor tweeted: “Impressed upon Hon’ble CM Mamata Banerjee that “Dialogue, discussion and deliberation, particularly amongst constitutional functionaries, like the Chief Minister and the Governor, are quintessential to democracy and inseparable part of constitutional governance.” 2/2</p><p>It now remains to be seen if the chief minister too responds to the governor through another letter or she chooses to ignore the letter.</p><p>While the chief minister had criticized the governor for holding back files, the governor too has said at different platforms that he has no pending files with him.</p><p>Meanwhile on Friday, the Calcutta High Court dismissed a public interest litigation alleging that the governor was working outside his constitutional jurisdiction. The court said the case against the governor was not worth admission. In the matters of the constitution, the court cannot interfere in the affairs of the governor. A division bench of Chief Justice Prakash Srivastava and Rajarshi Bharadwaj also said that the governor was not accountable in court for the rights conferred on him by the constitution.</p><p>A lawyer, Ramaprasad Sarkar had filed the PIL. The court said that according to Article 361 of the constitution of India they cannot take any such action against the governor.</p><p>Ridiculing the PIL, CPI(M) state leader Sujan Chakraborty, said, “The case was filed to give more powers to the governor. The state government is in collusion with the governor. It is common knowledge that the courts cannot decide on the matters of the governor. This was done to show that the state government is against the governor but that is not the actual reality. We feel what the governor is doing by bringing out the facts on public domain is not right. Neither do we support the chief minister, who is bringing out new allegations against the governor. This fight has become very ugly and cheap.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",
